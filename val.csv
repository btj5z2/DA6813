"(Sep 25, 2016  1:28 PM CDT) Authorities say seven people have been injured in an apparent fight in Boston's Theater District, the AP reports. The Boston Globe reports that Bernard O'Rourke, police superintendent of the bureau of field services, said officers responded to a report of a fight about 2:15am Sunday in the district, where bars and restaurants cater to nightlife crowds and had just closed. Police say people were stabbed with knives or bottles. Four of the victims were transported to receive medical treatment, while the other three walked into hospitals on their own, a police spokesman tells the Globe. Another police spokesman on Sunday afternoon told the AP the injuries appear to be non-life-threatening; earlier reports had said one person was critically injured. O'Rourke has said a suspect has been IDed—and per RT.com, that suspect was one of the wounded. Police are said to be seeking a second suspect. Emerson College, which has facilities in the area, alerted students to the incident in a Facebook post. The school has asked students to report any suspicious activity.

"(Jul 2, 2019  4:44 PM CDT) In 1979, the members of U2 were still in their teens when they performed at the Dandelion Market in Dublin. The guitarist of the band that opened for them was so impressed with their talent that he recorded their show on cassette tapes, explains Rolling Stone. Lo and behold, those tapes have now surfaced as the earliest known live recording of U2, according to the encyclopedic band site ATU2. The tapes have not been released, but you can hear samples of two songs— In Your Hand  and  Concentration Cramp.   I am pleased that I recorded the show,  Pete McCluskey tells ATU2,  and hadn’t realized the significance of it and its place in history until quite recently.  For the record, his band was named The Stougers.  They were just 17, 18, and a couple of years younger than myself and my band colleagues,  McCluskey recalls of U2. But his band had opened for them once before, and he made a point to bring his recorder to the next gig. The show catches U2  at a pivotal point in their development,  writes Andy Greene of Rolling Stone. Neither of two songs released in part have been heard before, though  Concentration Cramp  appears to have been a precursor to  Live My Life Tonight,  released later.

A little bit of satisfaction and about $65,000 now belongs to Chandana Keerthi Bandara, a former producer for the BBC's Sri Lankan news service who was fired after he opted to not cover the birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton's first child when he came to work the day after the blessed event, prioritizing instead coverage of the 30th anniversary of Sri Lanka's Black July. Told to publish something about the wee Windsor child, Bandara initially refused, then put something up about noon. That earned him disciplinary proceedings, a verdict of gross misconduct, and a final written warning, reports the Telegraph. When another allegation was made a year later, Bandara was sent packing after 18 years on the job. He sued the BBC for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination, and a tribunal has now found that that final written warning was unfair and contributed to his firing, though no racial discrimination occurred.  The BBC takes disciplinary matters very seriously and we are disappointed with the outcome of this unfair dismissal claim,  a rep tells the Independent, which notes the rep  could not specify why  the BBC was disappointed.

It's all the more remarkable because her husband was one of those firefighters rushing to get there. The drama began Tuesday night when Rachelle Flatt of Spokane Valley put her three kids to bed about 9:30, noticed flames on the patio, and called 911, reports KHQ. Then came the explosion—flames ignited a propane tank, and the blast sent smoke and flames into the home. Flatt first got her 3-year-old girl out the front door and into the hands of neighbors, reports the Spokesman-Review. Then she went back and got her 15-month-old girl, and back a third time though the thick smoke to get her 6-year-old boy.  That’s when I really started to panic,  she says.  I was running out of air.  She made it, though, with husband Pete on the way with his fellow firefighters.  My heart just dropped,  he recalls, upon hearing the address.

Police say a gunman entered the store with an AK-47-style rifle and opened fire just before 11am, injuring 26 others and causing general panic before giving himself up to police. Officials are considering capital murder charges for the man in custody, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, and are reading an anti-immigrant manifesto to see whether the gunman wrote it—which could turn the massacre into a terrorist act or federal hate crime.

"(Dec 29, 2020  9:45 AM) With the governor's executive order barring most evictions due to expire at year's end, the New York Legislature called a special session Monday to pass  one of the most comprehensive anti-eviction laws in the nation,  per the New York Times. The bill, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately signed, bars landlords from evicting most tenants for 60 days, protects landlords who own 10 or fewer apartments from foreclosure, and automatically renews tax exemptions for elderly or disabled homeowners. Protections are extended until May 1 for tenants who cite financial hardship tied to the coronavirus pandemic or a significant health risk related to a move, per Fox News. Up to 1.2 million New York households are at risk of losing their homes, according to consulting firm Stout, per the Times. In signing a $900 billion relief package on Sunday, President Trump approved $1.3 billion in rent relief for New Yorkers and stretched out a federal eviction moratorium. But state legislators took further action, as some argue the requirements for federal eviction protection are too rigid. Evictions can still proceed in cases where a judge finds tenants have repeatedly faced nuisance complaints, such as for noise. But that's not enough for some landlord groups, who argue tenants don't need to provide proof of hardship.  The cost of providing free housing cannot be fully borne by property owners,  says Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, per Politico.

"(Aug 7, 2013  10:14 AM CDT) A new study throws the whole concept of a  due date  into question, finding the length of pregnancy can naturally vary by as much as five weeks. The study of 125 women expands upon what the BBC reports are some fairly broad stats: Only 4% of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30% do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As LiveScience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. (The average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. The study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant.  The emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is,  says a study researcher. The upshot? Perhaps a  delivered by  date would be better than a  due date,  suggests a spokesperson for the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.","9 Months May Not Be 'Normal' Pregnancy, After All","____ Months May Not Be 'Normal' Pregnancy, After All",9,"Round( Divide( 268 , 30 ) , 0 )",1

Some 152,000 of them had to find an alternate way to get to class in the freezing rain this morning, amid a school-bus drivers strike, reports the NY Daily News. Schools issued MetroCards to affected students so they could take public transportation, and parents who opt to pay for a taxi or drive their kids can fill out forms for reimbursement.

"(Sep 20, 2018  6:25 AM CDT) Take your pick as to which of these statements from Alibaba founder Jack Ma is gloomier: He's going back on his pledge to create 1 million US jobs, and the US-China trade war that he blames for that plan's undoing is one that he believes could last two decades.  It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess,  the Chinese tech billionaire said Tuesday. He addressed the jobs plan, made after he met with then president-elect Donald Trump in January 2017, on Wednesday:  This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis. This promise can't be completed.  CNN provides background, explaining Ma's  vague promise  didn't involve building Alibaba facilities in the US, but rather by helping fire up small US businesses by enabling them to better tap into the Chinese market. The Wall Street Journal also uses the word  vague  to describe how critics viewed Ma's pledge, observing that, nearly two years later, Alibaba hasn't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far. Count the Washington Post among those critics. It points out that based on Commerce Department figures, 1 million new American jobs would require that US exports to China rise by an additional $206 billion a year. That's a more than 100% jump over 2017's $188 billion in exports, a figure that encompasses things that wouldn't benefit from Alibaba's platform, like airplanes.",Billionaire's Plan to Create 1M US Jobs Killed by Trade War,Billionaire's Plan to Create ____M US Jobs Killed by Trade War,1,Copy( 1 ),0

"(Dec 26, 2015  5:12 PM) Another school lesson has ended poorly, this time in Texas. Houston's Ed White Elementary School held a Multicultural Day earlier this month, with the school explaining via email that the kids would learn about cultures in places ranging from Spain to Israel. The email, in parentheses, stated that the children  will be doing henna,  a plant-based dye that's traditionally painted on the body in India, reports Click2Houston. Tammy Samour's husband read the email and didn't know what henna was. He does now. Tammy Samour, who didn't read the email, says she's outraged after her 7-year-old Leah came home from school with henna tattoos on her hands.  Somebody tattooed my daughter without my permission.  Samour is particularly incensed because the activity occurred the week before Christmas week.  We have family photos, opening presents, church, and she is going to be wearing that on her hands throughout the holiday.  KHOU reports the Clear Creek Independent School District offered to Photoshop Leah's hands in those holiday photos, but that wasn't enough to appease Samour.  Exploring other cultures is a wonderful thing. But tattooing another culture's expressions on my daughter is not acceptable. It's upsetting to go through Christmas with another religion's celebratory symbolism all over my daughter's hands.  The district says it regrets not spelling out what henna is in the email, and says it will  certainly will do a better job in the future to make sure that parents are informed.",7-Year-Old's Henna Tattoo a Big Problem for Mom,____-Year-Old's Henna Tattoo a Big Problem for Mom,7,Copy( 7 ),0
"(Nov 26, 2013  6:03 PM) A strange case is playing out in Israel over a woman's refusal to circumcise her son. In what Haaretz calls a  precedent-setting decision,  a rabbinical court has levied a fine of $140 a day for each day she does not circumcise him. The bill is currently at $700, but the unidentified woman refuses to budge.  I have no right to cut his organ and mutilate him,  she told Channel 2, as reported by the Times of Israel.  And the court has no right to force me to do so.  The court, however, says that  circumcision is a standard surgical procedure that is performed on every Jewish baby boy, so when one of the parents demands it, the other cannot delay it.  And that's where things get a little confusing. The child's parents are going through a divorce, and the mother says her soon-to-be ex initially agreed with the decision to leave the boy uncircumcised but changed his mind during the divorce proceedings. In its ruling against her, the court suggested this was part of a scheme of some sort on her part:  If the mother is given the opportunity to prevent the circumcision or use her objection [to the procedure] as a tool to make headway in the divorce struggle, we could find ourselves facing a flood of cases like these,  wrote the rabbis.  This trend must be stopped immediately.  Rabbinical courts have authority over all marriage issues, notes 972mag.com.

Kim Dong Chul had been detained in the North on suspicion of engaging in spying and stealing state secrets. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor after a brief trial in Pyongyang. North Korea's Supreme Court found Kim guilty of espionage and subversion under Articles 60 and 64 of the North's criminal code. When he was paraded before the media in Pyongyang last month, Kim said he had collaborated with and spied for South Korean intelligence authorities in a plot to bring down the North's leadership and had tried to spread religion among North Koreans before his arrest in the city of Rason last October. South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the country's main spy agency, has said Kim's case wasn't related to the organization in any way. Kim's sentencing comes on the heels of a 15-year sentence handed down on Otto Warmbier, an American university student who the North says was engaged in anti-state activities while visiting the country as a tourist earlier this year.",North Korea Gives US 'Spy' 10 Years Hard Labor,North Korea Gives US 'Spy' ____ Years Hard Labor,10,Copy( 10 ),0

In the study of 75 sedentary adults with rheumatoid arthritis or knee osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Rheumatology, researchers found that subjects who practiced an hour of yoga three times a week for eight weeks enjoyed higher energy, less depression, reduced pain, and improved flexibility and walking ability, reports Time. Researchers pegged the improvement at 20% over those in the non-yoga control group and say the benefits were still evident nine months later. Lead author Susan Bartlett tells Medical Daily that one subject even went on to become a marathon runner. More than 95% of the study's subjects were female, but Bartlett tells the website that for the purposes of this study, it made sense: 70% of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers are women. One caveat, one of the researchers tells Time: Not all yoga classes are equal and could even harm arthritis patients, so he advises checking with one's doctor and seeking out the gentler regimens found in classes for older, disabled, or pregnant students before heading straight into Downward-Facing Dog.",Yoga 3 Times a Week Pays Big Dividends,Yoga ____ Times a Week Pays Big Dividends,3,Trans( three ),1

The benefits-providing Zadroga Act that was signed into law earlier this year requires periodic reviews of any evidence of cancer, the New York Times reports. But the report, released yesterday, noted that  drawing causal inferences about exposures resulting from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the observation of cancer cases in responders and survivors is especially challenging since cancer is not a rare disease.  The Times notes that one in two men and one in three women will develop cancer during their lives; such a high probability makes it tougher to prove the 9/11 link. But  so many people have gotten such rare cancers—and at such young ages—that it seems obvious there must be a link,  Sen. Charles Schumer said.  We believe this report is premature and that the framework established by the Zadroga bill will demonstrate that those who were exposed to the witches' brew of toxins at Ground Zero have developed serious illnesses, including cancer, and deserve justice.

JAXA launched its Kounotori 6 spacecraft on Friday with tons of supplies bound for the International Space Station, where it's expected to arrive on Wednesday, reports NPR. Also on board is a 2,300-feet electrodynamic tether, or EDT, made of aluminum and steel, in the works for more than a decade. JAXA says it will use an electric current and Earth's magnetic field to slow down debris and shove it out of orbit and toward Earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up. The EDT and the Kounotori, which will also carry waste from the ISS, will then meet the same fate. It's unclear how many pieces of space junk might be destroyed using the EDT, but this is mostly a test. If all goes well, JAXA plans to create a second tether up to six miles in length, reports Bloomberg. The BBC notes this is one of a few efforts underway to tackle space junk, which poses hazards for astronauts and their equipment. In May, for example, a tiny piece of space junk—possibly a speck of paint—chipped a window in the ISS' Cupola observatory, reports Christian Science Monitor. As the ISS wouldn't stand a chance against some debris as large as a bus, it has to be moved to avoid an impact, says project chief Koichi Inoue. Kounotori's EDT  is a promising candidate to deorbit the debris objects at low cost,  JAXA says.

The answer, apparently, was a resounding yes: Not long after, Susie Clark spotted a teardrop-shaped 3.69-carat gem that she's dubbed the Hallelujah Diamond, per a park release.  The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent, metallic shine,  says Park Interpreter Waymon Cox, who adds that the pinto bean-sized diamond is the biggest gem of the 122 found so far this year at the park. But it pales slightly in comparison to a 6.19-carat whopper found a year ago, and it's less than a tenth the size of the biggest ever found there: a 40.23-carat gem named the Uncle Sam (that one was uncovered during a 1924 mining project; the site was converted into a state park in 1972). Cox adds Clark also likely had a little help from recent rain, which washes dirt away, leaving diamonds to sparkle in the sun.

All of this led to  a near-seven-figure legal bill for Hunter, a sunk suit against CBS, and [his] impaired reputation,  per his complaint. (The suit, which is asking for $1 million in damages, was filed by a lawyer who contributes op-eds to LawNewz). In the suit, Hunter blasts Allred and other lawyers at her firm for not interviewing witnesses who may have helped his case, among other grievances. Per Variety, Hunter's suit says the $800,000 legal bill he had to pay when he lost to CBS left him near bankruptcy. LawNewz also uncovered in March that the State Bar of California is looking into Allred's actions for misconduct, for undisclosed reasons.  Allred sandbagged her client to serve her personal pecuniary interests, her penchant for public fame, and to protect the malfeasance of her media allies,  the suit notes, adding she  needs to spend less time in front of a TV camera, and more time in an ethics library.  A statement from Allred's law firm calls Hunter's claims  worthless  and notes he  has been threatening to sue our law firm for approximately one year in an attempt to get our law firm to pay him money which he is not entitled to.",Tables Turned on Allred in $1M Fraud Suit,Tables Turned on Allred in $____M Fraud Suit,1,Copy( 1 ),0
"(Jun 17, 2017  5:00 AM CDT) John G. Avildsen, who directed Rocky and The Karate Kid—two dark-horse, underdog favorites that went on to become Hollywood franchises—died Friday in Los Angeles at age 81. Anthony Avildsen said his father died from pancreatic cancer and called him  a pretty extraordinary man in my estimation.  Rocky was a huge success. It won Oscars for best picture, director (Avildsen), and editing and was nominated for seven others. Rocky was a chance venture for Avildsen, reports the AP. Sylvester Stallone, then unknown, had written the script and sought Avildsen to direct it, but Avildsen was already working on another film. Suddenly the production company ran out of money and that film was canceled. A friend sent Avildsen the Rocky script.  On page 3, this guy (Rocky) is talking to his turtles, and I was hooked,  Avildsen remarked.  It was a great character study.  Avildsen agreed to direct Rocky even though he knew nothing about boxing. The film was shot on a tight budget, less than $1 million, and it was completed in 28 days.  The first time I showed it to 40 or 50 friends, they all freaked out, so that was encouraging,  he recalled.  But I guess when I saw the lines around the block, it began to take on a reality.  Five sequels followed, but Avildsen turned them down, until the fourth, Rocky V, in 1990. He said he considered it a good script and liked that Rocky would die. During the shooting the producers decided Rocky had to live.  You don't kill off your corporate assets,  Avildsen commented.

"(Jul 9, 2017  5:58 AM CDT) Actor Nelsan Ellis, best known for his memorable portrayal of Lafayette Reynolds on HBO's True Blood, has died at age 39. Ellis' manager, Emily Gerson Saines, confirmed the actor's death in an email Saturday. The Hollywood Reporter, which was first to report Ellis' death, quoted her as saying he died from complications of heart failure. The Illinois-born actor, who studied at Juilliard, played the role of Lafayette, a gay short order cook, on the HBO drama from 2008 to 2014, and more recently appeared in the CBS detective series Elementary. He also was a playwright and stage director. Ellis appeared as Martin Luther King Jr. in Lee Daniels' The Butler, and as singer Bobby Byrd in the James Brown biopic Get On Up. He also appeared in The Help, and the AP reports his castmate Octavia Spencer mourned his death on Instagram.  My heart breaks for his kids and family,  she wrote. Some fans tweeted one of his more famous scenes as Lafayette, where the character marches out of the kitchen to confront some bigoted diners. Ellis'  groundbreaking portrayal of Lafayette will be remembered fondly within the overall legacy of True Blood,  said HBO in a statement.  Nelsan will be dearly missed.  True Blood castmate Joe Manganiello tweeted that Ellis was  a wonderful person, a pioneer, and a one of a kind artist,  per CNN. Creator Alan Ball called Ellis  a singular talent whose creativity never ceased to amaze me. Working with him was a privilege.  In a 2012 interview, Ellis recalled that it took four auditions for him to nail the role of Lafayette. At first, he said, he was playing the role as a caricature, and was told to  go back to the drawing board and figure it out.  He began to channel his mother.

The former al-Qaeda propaganda chief suggests Islam should not be spread by violence in a rambling manifesto viewed by Channel 4 News. He also blasts Western society, the US military, and quotes from Richard Nixon and George W. Bush as well as the Koran. He says two further installments of the manifesto will explain the 9/11 attacks and reveal  the truth about the so-called war on terror.  The Koran  forbids us to use force as a means of converting  others, and  truth and reality never comes by muscles and force but by using the mind and wisdom,  writes Mohammed, who is being kept in solitary confinement at Guantanamo Bay.

"(Jun 9, 2015  12:02 PM CDT) CDC officials say a woman with an extremely rare form of tuberculosis came to the US from India and traveled to three different states before being diagnosed with an active case of the disease. Now she's isolated at a National Institutes for Health clinic in Maryland, and authorities are trying to track down  hundreds of people  who may have come into contact with her, NBC News reports. If it were just a simple case of TB, there wouldn't be such a brouhaha—but the unnamed patient has extensively drug-resistant TB, or XDR TB, which doesn't respond to some of the most powerful anti-TB drugs, per the World Health Organization. Although the disease is rare—the CDC says only 63 cases of it were noted between 1993 and 2011—TB bacteria can enter the air via coughs or sneezes and remain there for several hours, the agency notes. After spending time in India—the country with the largest number of TB cases in 2013, according to WHO—the woman flew back to Chicago in April, then traveled to Missouri and Tennessee over the next seven weeks, notes NBC. CNN points out as many as 8 weeks can pass between exposure and a positive TB test. A spokeswoman for the McHenry County Health Department in Illinois tells the Chicago Tribune it's keeping an eye on some people the woman was in close contact with and that the general public is likely not at risk. An NIH statement says the patient is being treated in a room  specifically designed for handling patients with respiratory infections, including XDR-TB,  per NBC; the CDC says she's in stable condition. The CDC reports only 30% to 50% of XDR TB cases can be cured, and treatment can take years, with doctors even performing surgery to remove infected areas.",Woman With Super-Rare TB Traveled to 3 States,Woman With Super-Rare TB Traveled to ____ States,3,Trans( three ),1

"(Jan 10, 2010  6:54 AM) Americans would see only a modest rise in health costs under the Senate's plan to extend coverage to 34 million people, government economic experts say in a new report. The study found that health spending, which accounts for about one-sixth of the economy, would increase by less than 1% than it otherwise would over the coming decade—even with so many more people receiving coverage. Over time, cost-cutting measures could reduce annual increases in health spending, offering substantial savings in the long run. At the same time, however, yesterday's report cited the tax on  Cadillac  health plans, as well as reductions in annual increases to Medicare providers, as having potential to hold down costs.

"(Dec 31, 2014  11:35 AM) In 2011, a passerby at a beach on the Gaspé peninsula in Quebec found partial skeletons whose mystery has, at least to some degree, been solved three years later. Among the remains were around a dozen long bones, pieces of a jawbone, and more than 25 vertebrae. Parks Canada anthropologists have determined that the bones belonged to three malnourished children from Europe, likely impoverished 19th-century Irish migrants who died in a shipwreck while trying to find a better life, the Globe and Mail reports.  They are witnesses to a tragic event,  says one archaeologist. Researchers found that the children likely ate a plant-based diet in Europe and that one child suffered from rickets, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, Archaeology reports. In addition, a button found nearby was linked to Europe in the 19th century. Officials believe they are likely victims of the wreck of the Carricks, a ship that crossed the Atlantic with Irish migrants trying to escape their homeland's famine only to sink in a storm in 1847. About 100 bodies washed ashore. There were 48 survivors, the CBC reported in 2012; they were taken in by local families. A memorial to the tragedy is just 40 yards away from where these children's bones were found. Says one local, who had ancestors among the shipwreck victims and survivors,  I have a link to these people—I almost consider them my family.  Thousands died on the Carricks and other  coffin ships  of the era, and the Washington Post notes that the sleeping quarters in such ships look similar to concentration camps.

"(Feb 27, 2009  8:09 AM) The US economy contracted at a staggering 6.2% pace at the end of 2008, the worst showing in more than a quarter-century, as consumers and businesses ratcheted back spending, plunging the country deeper into recession. That's drastically worse than the 3.8% the government originally estimated, and the 5.4% economists predicted. Looking ahead, economists predict consumers and businesses will keep cutting back spending, making the first six months of this year especially rocky. The new report offered grim proof that the economy's tailspin accelerated in the fourth quarter under a slew of negative forces feeding on each other. The economy started off 2008 on feeble footing, picked up a bit of speed in the spring, and then contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter.

More than 1 million checks for a combined $1.4 billion were distributed to dead people, according to a government watchdog report covering coronavirus relief spending approved by Congress as of April 30. In the rush to disburse $269 billion to 160.4 million people  as rapidly as possible,  as mandated by the Cares Act, Treasury officials followed procedures put in place for 2008 stimulus payments and  did not include using death records as a filter,  per NBC News. The Treasury doesn't have access to the Social Security Administration's full set of death records, as the IRS does, though it gained temporary access upon discovering that some payments were being made to dead people, reports the Washington Post. IRS officials raised concerns about the issue before payments were distributed to eligible Americans who'd filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return. But  counsel determined they did not have the legal authority to deny payments to people who had filed a return, even if they were deceased,  per the Post. On May 6, the IRS said payments to deceased or incarcerated individuals must be returned—but it doesn't yet have a plan in place for recouping the money, according to the Government Accountability Office report released Thursday. The IRS has now agreed to  consider cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return payments,  as recommended in the report.

The report, the result of a 15-month-long investigation, notes the explosion sent thousands of metal objects in all directions and hundreds hit the plane with  tremendous force,  Joustra said, per the Guardian. He added shrapnel from the Buk missile was found inside the bodies of the pilots, who died instantly, along with traces of paint from a Buk missile. The BBC's Anna Holligan, who spoke to relatives briefed on the report, says all passengers and crew would've lost consciousness immediately as the plane broke apart in the air.

Tyshawn Lee, an elementary school student headed to his grandmother's house, was shot in the head and back Monday in a neighborhood alley on the city's South Side. McCarthy told reporters Thursday that the slaying was the result of two gangs fighting, potentially in a string of retaliatory events dating back months. He said the boy's father isn't cooperating with police. McCarthy called it probably the  most abhorrent, cowardly, unfathomable crime that I've witnessed in 35 years of policing.

A bearded, emaciated man wearing only tattered underpants washed onto a remote Pacific atoll in the Marshall Islands yesterday, and told the locals who found him he'd been floating at sea in his 24-foot fiberglass boat since Sept. 2012. Jose Ivan and a friend—who Ivan says died several months ago—had set off from Mexico en route to El Salvador. While details remain sketchy, Ivan told a researcher on Ebon Atoll he survived on turtles, birds, and fish he caught with his bare hands, drinking turtle blood when there was no rain, the AFP reports.

A turtle was spotted on board, but no fishing gear.

"(Apr 8, 2010  4:40 AM CDT) That  heavenly  light at the end of the tunnel may have more to do with carbon dioxide than an afterlife, a new study finds. Slovenian researchers studying near-death experiences found that people who reported seeing their life—or light—flash before their eyes had higher levels of CO2 in their systems. Up to 25% of cardiac patients report having such experiences. The study, which followed only 52 patients, found an association between seeing light and higher levels of carbon dioxide, but that does not mean CO2 necessarily caused the effect, scientists pointed out. However, the findings seem to mesh with previous work on the link between the carbon dioxide and hallucinatory experiences.  It is potentially another piece of the puzzle, although much more work is needed,  one scientist tells the BBC.",Near-Death 'Heavenly Lights' Linked to CO2,Near-Death 'Heavenly Lights' Linked to CO____,2,Copy( 2 ),0

The tournament referee's office said the 23-time Grand Slam champion was being fined $10,000 for  verbal abuse,  $4,000 for the warning about coaching, and $3,000 for breaking her racket, per Fox News. The money will be taken from her $1.85 million runner-up prize money.

Several things went very wrong during the U.S. Open women's finals today,  tweeted King on Saturday. In her view,  coaching on every point should be allowed in tennis  and Williams shouldn't have been penalized for arguing:  When a man does the same, he's 'outspoken' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out the double standard.

Emissions rose 3.6% to a new record last year and have risen another 2.6% so far this year, putting the planet on what now appears to be an inevitable path toward climate change and more extreme weather, reports the New York Times. China and India's rapidly expanding economies led the emissions growth, which was more than enough to cancel out falling emission levels from Europe and the US. Representatives from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Doha to discuss climate change, but few expect the conference to bring the world much closer to solving the problem.

We kept smelling this awful smell every time a gust of wind would come,  a beachgoer tells FOX6.  We [checked] the beach next door and we found it was just lined with sharks.  WKRG reports close to 100 sharks were found, though the Alabama Marine Resources Division puts the number at 57, per AL.com. One tourist says about 40 sharks were entangled in a single net.

The 13-mile long Lower Aqueduct, which was fed by a spring south of Bethlehem and runs through four modern-day Jerusalem neighborhoods, was built by kings governing Judea and environs from roughly 140 BC to 37 BC. City rulers kept it up over the years, covering the open channel with terra cotta pipe about 500 years ago. It remained a major water-supply source until an electrical water distribution system replaced it roughly 100 years ago, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority. The IAA says it will cover part of the aqueduct  for the sake of future generations  and expose parts for access by the general public, Discovery reports. Meanwhile, archaeologists are marveling:  The aqueduct begins at the ‘En ‘Eitam spring, near Solomon’s Pools south of Bethlehem,  says IAA Director Ya'akov Billig.  Despite its length, it flows along a very gentle downward slope whereby the water level falls just one meter per kilometer of distance.  The original designers look pretty smart, too, having built the aqueduct in uninhabited areas where Jerusalem neighborhoods now exist, the Times of Israel notes.

The son of the woman from Winter Haven, Fla., died in October, this time resulting in a felony aggravated manslaughter charge against her. Per the Orlando Sentinel, the story begins Dec. 4, 2009, not even two weeks after baby Angelina was born. Piche-Pitts brought the infant into bed to breastfeed and dozed off, waking to find the baby  cold and stiff to the touch,  per an affidavit; Angelina's death was ruled accidental. On Oct. 6 of this year, her 18-day-old son, Javier, became unresponsive after she fell asleep in bed with him during a bottle feeding, the affidavit notes. His death was also ruled accidental, though his autopsy hasn't been finalized. What leads these two incidents into negligence territory is that Piche-Pitts had been warned both during her pregnancies and after the births about co-sleeping dangers—via training and counseling, and from hospital staff and family—and especially so after Angelina died, per the Polk County Sheriff's Office (which also gave WTSP a rap sheet on Piche-Pitts that includes burglary, domestic violence, and possession of meth).

"(Feb 2, 2017  4:32 PM) Stephen Peterson, son of convicted murderer and former police sergeant Drew Peterson, has come to believe his dad is guilty of more than killing Wife No. 3, for which he's been sentenced to 38 years in prison. He also thinks his father killed his fourth wife, and said so on a Lifetime show in January and again to the Chicago Tribune this month.  I don't want to come out and say he did it ... but, I'm sure he did it,  Stephen now says. Since his father's conviction in 2012 for the 2004 killing of Kathleen Savio, his third wife, Stephen has lived in his father's home and raised his dad's kids. He has his suspicions about the 2007 disappearance of Stacy Peterson, in which his father remains a suspect. Stephen says that at first he believed his dad's stories that Savio drowned accidentally and that Stacy left him for another man—even though, Stephen says, the day after Stacy went missing his father brought over his guns and more than $200,000 in checks for safekeeping. Stephen lost his job as an Oak Brook, Ill., police officer for failing to disclose details of interactions he had with his dad after the disappearance. And he's run through his pension raising his father's children. So when Lifetime called with a $10,000 offer to be on the show Monster in My Family, Stephen took the deal. He says he told his father about the show, which details the life Stephen, now 37, has had with Drew and Stacy's two children, who are in middle school; Stephen also looked after Drew's sons with Savio, who are now young adults. Stephen says there was no  a-ha moment,  when he changed his mind about his father's role in Stacy's disappearance, but he does recall her fear after Savio's death.

"(Apr 2, 2014  3:32 PM CDT) Police in New South Wales, Australia, stopped a car at a DUI checkpoint, gave the driver a breathalyzer, and promptly hauled him off to jail on drunk-driving charges, reports the Herald. Routine stuff, but this makes it a little more interesting: After the arrest, one of the two passengers slid into the driver's seat and drove off, only to get pulled over within minutes and hauled off to join his buddy in jail on DUI charges of his own. Not bad, but this truly elevates things: After that arrest, the remaining passenger got behind the wheel, drove off, and, yes, got stopped and charged with DUI, too. All three arrests took place within 20 minutes, notes the Nothing To Do With Arbroath blog, and all three men might be car-pooling again soon for their April 16 court appearances.

"(Feb 17, 2020  7:31 AM) The search for a missing Milwaukee woman and her two young daughters ended with a horrific find in a garage Sunday. Police say they found the bodies of 25-year-old Amarah Banks, 5-year-old Zaniya Ivery, and 4-year-old Camaria Banks in the garage following the arrest of Banks' boyfriend, Arzel Ivery, in Tennessee, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports. Banks and her daughters had not been seen since around 1am on Feb. 8, hours after she buried her baby son. The boy, 1-year-old Arzel, died of natural causes, family members say. Ivery, 25, has been charged with aggravated battery. Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales says he will also be charged with murder, reports CBS58. Morales says Ivery directed investigators to the garage after he was taken into custody. Banks and her daughters were reported missing the day after they were last seen, but an Amber Alert was not issued until a week later. Morales defended the delay when he spoke to reporters Sunday, saying foul play was not initially suspected.  People will blame the police department regarding these deaths,  he said.  That's unfair, uncalled for, and unwarranted.  Relatives say Ivery was the father of Arzel and Zaniya.

That's the starting bid for the  dream hunt  with Donald Trump Jr. being auctioned off by Safari Club International during its annual convention taking place Wednesday through Saturday in Reno, Nevada, USA Today reports Trump Jr. is the keynote speaker at the event (and the Beach Boys are the musical act), and the Alaska hunt goes up for auction on the last night. The 7-day hunt will target Sitka black-tailed deer and sea ducks, with each hunter allowed to harvest two deer. The Guardian reports thousands are expected to attend the convention, which bills Trump Jr. as a person  who's [sic] passion for the outdoors makes him the number one ambassador for our way of life.  Animal rights organizations are unsurprisingly displeased, with the head of the Humane Society calling it  the largest meeting in the world of people who celebrate the senseless killing, buying and selling of dead animals for bragging rights.  REO Speedwagon was also set to perform at the convention, but pulled out under pressure from animal rights groups. In response to the controversy, SCI said hunting contributes significantly to conservation efforts and called Trump Jr.  an accomplished conservationist.

Why would we bail out the state when it’s like giving drugs to a drug addict?  asked one congressman. Experts say bailing out California would look bad—picture unemployed Michigan autoworkers alongside chardonnay-sipping San Franciscans and pool-lounging Beverly Hills starlets—and would also set a dangerous precedent for other cash-strapped states.

At least, that is, according to a study that finds we should take 17-minute breaks after every 52 minutes of work. The idea, the Muse reports, is to treat those 52-minute work periods  as sprints,  while during the breaks,  we’re talking completely dedicating yourself to not working,  Julia Gifford writes. Her team used an app called DeskTime, which keeps track of what workers are doing, to determine the habits of the highest-achieving 10% of employees studied. Researchers have long said that the human brain isn't designed for eight straight hours of focusing, Fast Company reports. And sitting for eight hours isn't good for us either, the Muse notes. Instead, we should take breaks—and actually get away from our computers, perhaps taking a walk, talking with coworkers, or getting a healthy snack.

But her boasts about them have some red with anger rather than green with envy. After the West Australian explored Joan Howard's collection, which she has stored in Perth, Egypt's Heritage Taskforce demanded the Australian government investigate the 95-year-old—dubbed  Indiana Joan —whom it accuses of looting ancient artifacts while her husband, Keith Howard, worked in senior roles with the UN in the Middle East in the 1960s and '70s. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says an investigation is now underway and any illegal items found will be returned to their country of origin, reports the Australian AP. The West Australian stressed Howard took the artifacts—including some she found while volunteering on digs— before laws changed and it became legally difficult to do so.  The UNESCO convention preventing illicit transport of such items, for instance, was passed in 1970. But the BBC reports individual countries Howard visited have had similar laws on the books since the 1950s; Egypt has had laws protecting its artifacts since the 1880s. Archaeologist Monica Hanna of Egypt's Heritage Taskforce argues in an open letter that Howard  behaved as a pirate. ... These activities decontextualize the cultural heritage,  leaving it  with holes that cannot be filled.

Some 150,000 years ago, a young girl lost her baby tooth, and it fell into the sediment of a cave in Siberia from which the first three (and thus far only) other fossils identified in 2010 as being Denisovan were found, reports Live Science. Before then, the hominin group that's as genetically distinct from modern humans as Neanderthals was completely unknown. This fourth fossil is the oldest, per the paper in the Science Advances journal, suggesting that the mysterious group lived in Central Asia so long ago that there was likely greater interaction with, and thus more potential to interbreed with, Neanderthals—something we humans appear to have done, too. Five years ago, scientists would have probably had to destroy the tooth to study its genetic fingerprints, but recently Viviane Slon at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany was able to scrape the tooth's surface and drill into its root to collect 10 milligrams of material that contained the DNA her team ultimately studied.  We only have relatively little data from this archaic group, so having any additional individuals is something we're very excited about,  she tells the New York Times. The other three fossils, a finger bone and two molars, were also unearthed in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia.

Some 23,000 ER visits each year are attributed to everything from herbal pills to vitamins that cause cardiovascular problems, severe allergic reactions, and vomiting, particularly in young adults, according to a new study from the FDA and CDC. They tracked ER visits from 63 hospitals over 10 years, per the New York Times and Time, and found about 10% of patients needed to be hospitalized; the study didn't review whether any deaths occurred. Though prescription drugs send 30 times as many people to the ER annually, most are older adults; 28% of people who visited the ER because of supplements were 20 to 34, and half of those visits involved weight-loss or energy aids, per NBC News. Dietary supplements aren't required to carry warning labels about side effects, don't require FDA approval, and are generally  considered safe until proved otherwise,  notes the Times.  The system has failed,  says a Harvard professor who calls the findings  disheartening.   It's failing to protect consumers from very serious harms.  Industry officials claim half of all Americans use dietary supplements, meaning 23,000 ER visits represents a sliver of users.

They have extensive administrative duties in a school that cut some standard administrative positions, and they must hold up to tough scrutiny to get rehired. Turnover ended up being high across a four-year period, the Atlantic notes, with 20 out of 43 teachers working for only one year. (At city middle schools, about 27% of teachers don't do a second year.) Also worth noting: Only 43% of eighth-graders at the school passed state math tests last year—but that beats the 26% rate across New York City, the Journal notes.

But it looks like that's exactly what's about to happen: Thanks to work done by Claire, now 14 and a high school freshman, and Wiener, who died in December at age 92, the state House and Senate have both passed a bill requiring public schools to teach students about the Holocaust and other genocides, the Washington Post reports. The state's Democratic governor, Kate Brown, must still sign it into law. As Claire explained to Oregon Public Broadcasting after Wiener's death, it had been his lifelong dream to get such mandatory statewide curriculum standards implemented, and she decided to help him achieve it. She got in touch with Rob Wagner, a state senator who ended up co-sponsoring the bill, and arranged a meeting between him and Wiener so that Wagner could hear the man's harrowing story—most of his family, including his father, was killed during the Holocaust, and Wiener was imprisoned in five concentration camps. Claire's mom explained to the Lake Oswego Review in September that Oregon didn't previously have mandatory Holocaust education, and the way districts across the state handled it was  all over the place.  Ten other states already have laws mandating Holocaust education, per the Statesman Journal. Wiener explained, while testifying at the Capitol in September,  Learning about the Holocaust is not just a chapter in recent history, but a derived lesson how to be more tolerant, more loving and that hatred is, eventually, self-destructive.

No deaths have been reported in the Bahamas, notes the AP. Last night, the storm weakened to category 1—where it should remain for a few days—but not before killing 11, including a baby, and destroying homes in Cuba; it was the worst storm there since Dennis in 2005, officials say. Winds reached 110 mph, notes Reuters. Nine others were killed in Haiti, and one in Jamaica. This morning could see tropical storm conditions in parts of Florida. Most of the US East Coast faces a 90% chance of gale-force winds, intense rain, flooding, and perhaps snow from Sunday to Wednesday, a US forecaster says; New Jersey could be hit with tropical storm-force winds Tuesday.

They chased him down the street and first attacked his head with their machetes and then attacked him all over his body,  a police commissioner says. The attackers fled; Das, 33, was declared dead at a hospital. He wrote for website Mukto-Mona, or Free Mind, which was once moderated by Bangladeshi-American Avijit Roy.

"(May 17, 2016  7:00 PM CDT) The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, rejecting the fierce objections of a US ally and setting Congress on a collision course with the Obama administration, the AP reports. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, approved by voice vote, had triggered a threat from Riyadh to pull billions of dollars from the US economy if the bill is enacted. The legislation, sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chuck Schumer, D-NY, gives victims' families the right to sue in US court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks that killed thousands in New York, the Washington, DC, area, and Pennsylvania. The House still must act on the legislation. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims have urged the Obama administration to declassify and release 28 pages of US intelligence that allegedly discusses possible Saudi involvement in the attacks. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir denied earlier this month that the kingdom made any threats over the bill. He said Riyadh had warned that investor confidence in the US would shrink if the bill became law.  In fact, what they [Congress] are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,  Al-Jubeir said in a May 3 statement. The Treasury Department said Monday that Saudi Arabia in March held $116.8 billion in Treasury debt.

Megan Huntsman, 39, has been booked on six counts of murder. Investigators believe she gave birth to the babies, at least six of which were born alive, between 1996 and 2006 and suffocated or strangled them as soon as they were born, reports the Deseret News.

The paper spoke with 38 women, 31 on the record, who say the longtime writer/director sexually harassed them on movie sets, during interviews, and even on the street, using his Hollywood credentials as a way to get them into abusive situations. Several of the women say Toback, who directed indie movies like Black & White and Two Girls and a Guy, would approach them on the street, brag about his friendship with Robert Downey Jr. or his Oscar nomination for writing the 1991 Warren Beatty film Bugsy, and then invite them somewhere under the auspices of interviewing them or having them read for a part in an upcoming film. Once they were alone, the women say Toback would quickly become inappropriate. One woman recounts walking down the street with Toback in Manhattan as he questioned her about masturbation and pubic hair. Many of the women describe experiences of Toback demanding they get naked and of him rubbing up against them to the point of ejaculation. These incidents stretch back decades, and other publications had previously published victims' accounts of Toback's behavior, including Gawker.

Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, 45, is in jail and faces a murder charge for the shooting death of 31-year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot seemingly at random on a pedestrian pier Wednesday. Turns out US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was about to deport Lopez-Sanchez again in March, but gave him to the San Francisco County Sheriff over a drug-related warrant, says a source in federal law enforcement. That's when the story took an unexpected turn. The sheriff let Lopez-Sanchez go, saying he had already served his time for felony re-entry after deportation and had no outstanding warrants, KTVU reports. The sheriff also ignored ICE's request to detain him and send a notice before freeing Lopez-Sanchez—because city officials see  immigration detainers  as violations of the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, according to the sheriff's legal counsel.

Memorial Day began as Decoration Day, honoring those who died in the Civil War. There were bitter debates about whether it started in the North or South, which persisted until 1966, when President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, NY, the holiday's official birthplace. Only after World War I did the day come to honor all American war dead.  Seen one way, the Memorial Day story traces a heartening journey  of a divided nation coming back together, Dionne writes. But let's not forget its Civil War roots. The political conflicts of that era  bear eerie similarities to our own.  No, we're not dealing with anything as important as slavery, but there are stark regional differences over federal and judicial power, the constitution, and patriotism.

In a deal announced Tuesday, Exxon says the former oil executive who resigned on Dec. 31 will sell his 611,000 shares of Exxon, worth about $55.5 million, and receive the value of a little over 2 million restricted shares, now worth about $184 million, in an independently managed trust, reports Bloomberg. Tillerson would have received the 2 million shares over a decade had he reached Exxon's mandatory retirement age of 65 in March, reports the AP. In total, he'll lose about $7 million, including $4.1 million in cash bonuses and benefits he would've received over the next three years, per Politico. Tillerson also agrees not to work in the oil and gas industry for 10 years; if he breaks that condition, the money in the independent trust will be given to  one or more charities involved in fighting poverty or disease in the developing world  without input from Tillerson or Exxon, the company says, adding Tillerson will  sever all ties with the company to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements associated with his nomination as secretary of state.",Rex Tillerson Makes $240M Exit From Exxon,Rex Tillerson Makes $____M Exit From Exxon,240,"Round( Add( 55.5 , 184 ) , 0 )",1
"(Feb 20, 2018  11:52 AM) Louisville must vacate its 2013 men's basketball title following an NCAA appeals panel's decision to uphold sanctions against the men's program in the sex scandal case. The Cardinals will have to vacate 123 victories including the championship, and return millions in conference revenue from the 2012-15 NCAA Tournaments, per the AP. The decision announced Tuesday by the governing body's Infraction Appeals Committee ruled that the NCAA has the authority to take away championships for what it considers major rule violations. Louisville now must forfeit its third NCAA title, victories, and income from 2010-14, when the violations occurred. The decision culminates the governing body's investigation that followed allegations in a 2015 book by escort Katina Powell that former Cardinals basketball staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits.  I cannot say this strongly enough: We believe the NCAA is simply wrong,  said Louisville interim President Dr. Greg Postel. He made the case that the university admitted wrongdoing and cooperated with the investigation.  Under the NCAA's own rules, this cooperation should have been a factor in the severity of the punishment,  he said.  Instead, it was ignored.

The news emerged at an emotional press conference Friday in Rochester, New York.  I never thought I would see this day, and now it's here,  said Wendy's mother, Marlene Jerome.  I just wish my husband had been alive to see this.  Suspect Timothy Williams, 56, was arrested Wednesday at his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and charged with second-degree murder, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. Officials relied on DNA taken from semen during an autopsy, but a 1999 search on the FBI's DNA database came up cold. Then came a  familial DNA  test. Approved by New York law in 2017, familial DNA searches can identify the suspect's family members and generate new leads. In this case, officials say Williams lived near Wendy when she vanished on Thanksgiving Day 1984 while delivering a birthday card to her closest friend. The 14-year-old died  from massive blunt force trauma as well as multiple lacerations about her body,  said Rochester Police Capt. Frank Umbrino at the press conference, per 13WHAM.  Honestly the extent of the injuries are too horrendous to talk about here. What it is safe to say is that Wendy did put up a fight.

Now the site has named a new potential Obama relative: the first documented African-American slave. CNN reports on the result of some 500 hours of work by four genealogists, who were able to link Obama, via, perhaps surprisingly, his mother's family, with John Punch. Ancestry.com explains that Punch was an indentured servant in Virginia whose foiled escape in 1640 earned him a lifetime of slavery (this was years before Virginia slavery laws came into effect). The team apparently decided to begin digging after learning Stanley Ann Dunham had African ancestors—white Virginians who descended from an African man. The genealogists then traced Obama to a Virginia family named Bunch, and  all of the surviving evidence we studied very strongly points to conclusion John Bunch is the son of John Punch.  (Ancestry.com explains that because Punch had children with a free white woman, those children were awarded her free status.)",Obama Roots Traced to 1st African-American Slave,Obama Roots Traced to ____st African-American Slave,1,Trans( first ),1

Now, a conclusion: An Italian court on Monday found Lucasz Herba guilty of kidnapping Chloe Ayling last July and sentenced him to 16 years and nine months. Ayling, then 20, said she was attacked by two men after flying to Milan and going to an apartment for a photo shoot. The BBC reports she was reportedly injected with the tranquilizer ketamine.  When I woke up I was wearing a pink bodysuit and the socks I'm in now,  she said in a statement to police published in Italian media.  I realized I was in the [trunk] of a car, with my wrists and ankles tied and my mouth taped. I was inside a bag, with only a small hole that allowed me to breathe.  She was held in an Italian farmhouse for six days and was ultimately released by her kidnappers at the British Consulate; they had allegedly variously told her they wanted ransom money and planned to sell her on the dark web. Herba, 30, argued that he was in love with Ayling, whom he had met on Facebook, and wanted to boost her career by getting her publicity via the kidnapping—an idea inspired by the film By Any Means. Prosecutors called him a  narcissist and a fantasist who was obsessed with Miss Ayling,  and the court determined Ayling wasn't involved in the plot.  This is vindication—her story is true,  her agent tells the Guardian, which reports prosecutors are trying to extradite Herba's brother from Britain in connection with the case.

"(Nov 10, 2020  5:07 PM) After evading justice for 48 years in the 1972 murder of 20-year-old Jody Loomis, Terrence Miller didn't live to hear the guilty verdict against him. Police in Snohomish County, Washington, say the 78-year-old killed himself Monday morning, around three hours before a jury that started its deliberations Friday found him guilty of first-degree murder, the Everett Herald reports. The verdict was delivered despite a defense motion to dismiss the case following Miller's death.  I'm glad that we got to hear the verdict,  said Jim Scharf, the lead sheriff's detective in the case. Loomis, who had been riding her bike to visit her horse in a stable near Bethell, was found dying on a remote dirt road on Aug. 23, 1972, the Washington Post reports. She had been raped and shot in the head. The case was cold for decades until 2008, when a crime lab technician discovered a semen stain on a boot Loomis had been wearing. Searches of genetic information on genealogy websites—the same method that caught the Golden State Killer—identified Miller as a suspect in 2018 and he was arrested in 2019 after DNA recovered from a coffee cup he had discarded was found to be an exact match for the DNA on the boot. He was freed on $1 million bond after the arrest. The Herald notes that this appears to be the oldest case in the world in which forensic genealogy has led to a conviction. With Miller now guilty but dead, the next step in the case is unclear. Prosecutor Craig Matheson says there will be a follow-up hearing next month to  put this to bed properly.",Suspect in 1972 Murder Kills Himself Hours Before Verdict,Suspect in ____ Murder Kills Himself Hours Before Verdict,1972,Copy( 1972 ),0

"(Oct 8, 2012  12:20 PM CDT) From a PBS exec's husband who defended the station's funding to a congressman who sought tax breaks for racehorse owners before buying seven horses: A Washington Post investigation finds 73 members of Congress who have recently sponsored or co-sponsored bills that help industries to which they have personal ties. And the lawmakers aren't blind to potential conflicts of interest: They check in with ethics committee lawyers thousands of times per year. From 2007 to 2011, those lawyers offered some 2,800 opinions on such matters, making 40,000 phone calls in the process. But these communications rarely seek to dissuade legislators from their goals; in fact, they typically help justify the efforts. Lawmakers argue that they're fighting for the greater good, which in some cases matches their own interests. And indeed, ethics rules seem to support that argument, offering exemptions to a financial conflict-of-interest rule. For instance,  if a dairy farmer represented a dairy farming state in the Senate... he would not fall under the strictures of this rule,  says the Senate ethics manual. But it's time to tighten such rules, experts tell the Post.

Bruno Dey is 93 and in poor health, per Deutsche Welle, but prosecutors say that in the height of World War II, he was a 17-year-old SS sharpshooter capable of climbing up and down the watch towers at the Stutthof death camp in what is now Poland. Some 120,000 prisoners were held there, and more than half would die. Dey, whose name was found on SS clothing in Stutthof’s archives in 2016, is charged as an accessory to murder in 5,230 deaths—5,000 attributed to hostile conditions, 200 to gassing, and 30 to a fatal shot—between 1944 and 1945, reports the BBC. His case is being heard in juvenile court due to his age at the time. Though he's admitted to seeing  emaciated figures  and  people who had suffered,  Dey denies that he  knowingly supported  the murders of Jewish prisoners or  carried out execution orders,  as prosecutors allege, per Deutsche Welle and the Local. As Dey sees it, there was little the teen could do to stand up to Adolf Hitler's regime when he was sent to the camp rather than the war front, owing to a heart disease. As Dey's health is poor, there's a risk his trial will be halted.

Authorities received a 911 call described as a hang-up around 11:30pm last night and responded to a home in the Tulsa suburb to find five people, including juveniles, stabbed to death, reports KJRH. Another female teenager at the scene was in critical condition and taken to a hospital, reports the AP, while another child was uninjured. Authorities say two teens, 16- and 18-year-old males, ran from the home as police arrived. A canine unit traced them to a wooded trail behind the home; both were arrested. Police say all nine people involved were family members who lived at the home, per BuzzFeed.

"(Nov 4, 2018  6:31 AM) Washington, DC, appears poised to become the first municipality in the nation to let 16-year-olds vote in national elections, including presidential races. A measure to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 cleared a committee last week and now heads to the full council, reports WTOP. To pass, it needs the support of a majority of the 13-member city council, and WJLA reports that eight members already have voiced their approval. While a handful of US cities allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, none grants the right in national elections. DC has an estimated 10,000 teens of that age, most of them minorities, per WJLA.  At the age of 16, your legal relationship with the government changes,  says council member Charles Allen, who introduced the measure. He points out that many 16-year-olds get jobs and begin paying taxes, and they also start driving.  Ironically, they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘End Taxation Without Representation.’ I think it’s time to change that.  Allen says he was inspired in part by the youth political movement that surfaced after school shootings. If passed by the council and signed by the mayor, the measure must undergo a 30-day congressional review period.

Xofluza is a pill that can reduce severity and shorten duration of flu symptoms after just one dose, the AP reports. It was developed by the Roche Group and Shionogi & Co. It works about as well as Tamiflu, Roche's older flu treatment, which is also available in cheaper generic versions. Tamiflu is taken twice daily for five days. Health officials have said an estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter, the disease's highest death toll in at least four decades.

That's per a statement from the country's tourism ambassador to the UK, announcing an unusual approach to boost tourism within its borders during the pandemic: an offer of $3,000 to any visitor who contracts the coronavirus there, Vice reports.  We want to reassure tourists they can come to Uzbekistan,  adds Sophie Ibbotson in the statement. The $3,000 figure was arrived at because that's about the cost of the medical care that Uzbekistan citizens get for free get if they're infected. It's all part of the nation's  Safe Travel Guaranteed  campaign, given the OK by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to coax travelers back. The compensation is conditional: The tourist must have been exploring Uzbekistan with a local tour guide who's been certified in safety and hygiene guidelines. There's a reason why the country is making this investment: Insider notes it's the fourth fastest-growing tourism market, according to UN stats. Currently Uzbekistan is welcoming back visitors from low-risk nations like Japan and South Korea; those coming from elsewhere will have to self-quarantine for 14 days when they get there. The Telegraph notes Cyprus has taken a similar tack, offering to pay vacation costs for any tourists infected while visiting. Uzbekistan has had just 88 deaths since the pandemic started, with about 17,000 cases overall out of a country of 33 million.

Many problems may be minor, including typographical errors in paperwork, reports the Washington Post. Some of them may be linked to more serious issues, such as misplaced bodies, but how extensive the problem is won't be known until the daunting study is completed. An accounting of each grave was ordered by Congress after an Army probe found mismarked or unmarked graves, unearthed urns, and a mysterious mass grave. Now each gravestone has been photographed and cataloged, and investigators are matching the details to some 500,000 paper records scanned into the survey's computer system. Certain older sections of the cemetery are proving to be especially problematical. A map of an area for slaves and black Civil War soldiers, for example, shows 70 graves that don't currently exist.

But even as her company's controversy grew, Bresch did something else that's getting scrutinized: She unloaded about 100,000 shares of stock on August 9, to the tune of a $5 million profit. Bresch did so under a 10b5 plan, which spans a certain waiting period and are set up to avoid the appearance of insider trading, reports the Guardian.  Yet,  as the Guardian writes,  Bresch did not need insider information to know that trouble lay ahead.  The grumbling about the price of EpiPen goes back to at least last September, when Bloomberg reported on EpiPen's marketing success story while noting the price had gone up 400%. Mylan subsequently hiked EpiPen's price again. In June, Wells Fargo noted in a report that Mylan had jacked prices on seven products by at least 100%, and on 24 products by at least 20%, hikes it said  could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk.  Mylan shares went from $49.20 per share on August 19, 10 days after Bresch's sale, to $43.11 on August 24—a $3 billion loss in value, notes Raw Story.

About $2 million in gold and $1.8 million in silver ends up in Switzerland's sewers each year, according to an environmental study commissioned by the Swiss government. Strange as it sounds, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology say it's not much of a surprise that 95 pounds of gold and 6,600 pounds of silver from Switzerland's gold refineries and watchmaking industry find a way into wastewater systems, along with trace amounts of rare earth minerals used in electronic components and even some paints, per CNN Money. If you're considering donning a hazmat suit for a smelly treasure hunt, however, you may want to reconsider. After checking 64 wastewater treatment plants across the country for  elements discharged in effluents or disposed of in sewage sludge  and determining they pose no real danger to the environment, researchers generally concluded the metals aren't worth the trouble it would take to collect them, reports Atlas Obscura. They note, however, that in some areas where gold refineries are abundant,  concentrations of gold in sewage sludge are sufficiently high for recovery to be potentially worthwhile.  US sewers see a similar phenomenon.

It took so long that Wood's lawyers filed an emergency appeal to stop the procedure after an hour because they say their 55-year-old client was still gasping for air at that point, reports the Guardian. According to the court filing cited by the LA Times, the lethal injection began at 1:52pm local time. Five minutes later, the state said Wood was sedated,  but at 2:02 he began to breathe,  wrote the attorneys.  At 2:03 his mouth moved. Mr. Wood has continued to breathe since that time.

A senior police official says that toll could rise, since  some people had taken the bodies of their relatives before police arrived,  AFP reports. Based on witness and police reports cited in the AP and BBC, between 1,000 and 1,500 people had gathered before sunrise outside of where the handout was set to take place. Some reports say the site was a chewing tobacco factory compound, while the AP reports it was the home of a tobacco businessman. It's also unclear based on various reports whether the crowd forced their way through the gates or if the rush happened when the gates were opened. What is clear is the devastation that took place once the stampede started. The BBC notes TV images showed  hundreds of blood-spattered sandals lying at the factory gate,  while AFP reports of relatives rushing through the entrance to find the bodies of loved ones. Such giveaways are common during the holy month of Ramadan, when wealthy families offer up their hand-me-downs to the less fortunate, and similar stampedes have happened in the past, the Guardian notes.

"(Dec 18, 2013  12:09 AM) Fighting in South Sudan has killed up to 500 people, according to the United Nations, which fears the violence in the oil-rich East African country is  largely along ethnic lines.  The US has ordered its citizens to leave the country immediately. The president of South Sudan—the world's newest country—has blamed the violence on a failed coup attempt by soldiers loyal to his former deputy, who belongs to a different ethnic group. As tens of thousands of people seek refuge at UN compounds in the capital, there are  disturbing reports of ethnically-targeted killings,  with most of the fighting pitting soldiers from President Salva Kiir's majority Dinka tribe against those from former deputy Riek Machar's Nuer tribe, says the South Sudan analyst for the International Crisis Group. The government says 10 people have been arrested in connection with the alleged coup plot, and five remain at large, including Machar, whom the US Embassy says it is not harboring.",UN: 500 Killed in South Sudan Clashes,UN: ____ Killed in South Sudan Clashes,500,Copy( 500 ),0
"(Jun 17, 2011  8:20 AM CDT) A group of kids got a bitter lesson in American justice when they were hit with a $500 fine for operating a lemonade stand without a license. The real rub? The profits were earmarked for a charity to fight pediatric cancer. Officials said they cracked down on the stand, set up near the US Open in Bethesda, Maryland, because it was a major operation.  Cute little kids making five or ten dollars is a little bit different than making hundreds. You've got coolers and coolers here,  the inspector grumbled. The fine was reportedly issued after they ignored several warnings. But some consumers were wondering why authorities were letting the public continue to get squeezed by hustlers in the area who, after buying a nearly $300 permit, are selling parking spaces on their lawns for as much as $60 a head.

"(Jul 6, 2010  7:49 AM CDT) Democrats are feeling the wrath of a financial sector scorned. Wall Street donations to the Democrats’ two congressional campaign committees are down 65% from the 2008 election cycle, the Washington Post reports. Big donors in general are staying away, giving just $49.5 million, compared to $81.3 million in 2008. Smaller donations have filled the gap—the funds are down only 16% overall—but party leaders are still concerned. Part of the problem is that the well-connected Chuck Schumer isn’t headlining the Democratic Senatorial committee anymore. But financial reform is a much bigger factor, says the committee’s current chair.  It’s no secret the big banks were against it.  The CEOs of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, for example, who’ve donated a combined $115,000 to the committees over the past two election cycles, haven’t given a penny this year.",Wall Street Dumps Dems: Donations Down 65%,Wall Street Dumps Dems: Donations Down ____%,65,Copy( 65 ),0

But these are no ordinary immigrants. For the first time, Ko Yong Suk and husband Ri Gang are revealing their identities: as aunt and uncle to Kim Jong Un. Those names are their Korean ones; in a bid to protect their privacy, the Washington Post isn't sharing the names they use here or the town where they live in a house paid for with $200,000 they say was given to them by the CIA. But the paper is sharing plenty of tidbits it gained in nearly 20 hours of interviews about the Hermit Kingdom—like Kim's real age. Ko, the 60-year-old sister of Kim's late mother, says Kim was born in 1984, not 1982 or 1983 as thought. And she's sure of that, as her own son was born that year.  I changed both of their diapers,  she says. While the couple doesn't have  any nuclear or military secrets  to share, they do know a lot about the man they repeatedly called  Marshal Kim Jong Un,  including that he was groomed to be leader from age 8. Top generals even attended his birthday party and bowed to him, according to the pair. As for his love of basketball, Ko says Kim's mother told him playing the sport would help him grow taller, closing the height gap between him and his friends. As for their 1998 decision to defect, made while they were living in Switzerland,  this is where Ko and Ri's version of events starts to become opaque,  the Post writes.  Given that Ri is trying [to] get back into Kim Jong Un's good graces, he has reason to present their defection as nothing but altruistic.

The new figure follows a meeting in which economic experts predicted a loss of 4 million jobs next year and an unemployment rate of 9%. Obama's proposed stimulus package calls for up to $775 billion in spending, but a growing chorus of experts says even that's not enough. A top Obama aide predicted the downturn will be  more severe than anything we’ve experienced in the past half-century.  Obama encouraged advisers to develop  bolder  solutions, which will include creating jobs for the unemployed, tax relief for low-wage and middle-income workers, and revitalizing the nation’s infrastructure.

"(Mar 26, 2020  2:21 AM CDT) The Trump administration has been controversially referring to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as the  Chinese virus  or  Wuhan virus,  and three officials from G7 countries tell the Washington Post that Mike Pompeo's insistence on using the term  Wuhan virus  led to a rift at Wednesday's Group of Seven meeting, which was held via video conference. Per ABC News, foreign ministers were planning to issue a joint declaration on the virus, but Pompeo insisted the term  Wuhan virus,  which has been decried by world leaders and health organizations, be included. Because of that, the ministers failed to agree on a joint statement, and no statement specifically referencing the pandemic was issued. Meanwhile, the president himself has stopped calling it the  Chinese virus  because, he says,  Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it.   We tried, you’ll remember, from the opening days to get our scientists, our experts on the ground there so that we could begin to assist in the global response to what began there in China, but we weren’t able to do that. The Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t permit that to happen,  Pompeo said at the meeting.  The Chinese Communist Party poses a substantial threat to our health and way of life, as the Wuhan virus outbreak clearly has demonstrated.  After the meeting, Pompeo downplayed the role of the term in the group's discussions, saying there were simply  tactical differences  in how ministers wanted to approach the situation.  Make no mistake about it,  he said, per Fox News,  everyone in that meeting this morning was very focused on making sure that we not only solve the health crisis associated with the Wuhan virus but also the economic challenges that face the globe as we confront it as well.","At G7, Pompeo's Insistence on 'Wuhan Virus' Caused Rift","At G____, Pompeo's Insistence on 'Wuhan Virus' Caused Rift",7,Copy( 7 ),0

"(Feb 16, 2019  2:35 PM) A Utah mail carrier is retiring with a perfect record after an incredible 69 years on the job—and attributes his longevity to the fact that he actually enjoyed it, Fox News reports.  Nobody has ever accused me of being smart, and I didn't know you had to quit when you are 65, and I have enjoyed driving the truck, so it is what I wanted to do all my life, and I have enjoyed driving the truck,  Jack Lund, 91, tells KSL-TV. Figuring he's driven about 3.5 million miles since 1949 between a Salt Lake depot and smaller, rural offices, Lund says he took the timeworn post-office motto ( Neither snow, nor rain... ) very seriously. In fact, he recalls a delivery that was impeded by four feet of snow on a mountain south of Panguitch.  The highway patrolman told me I couldn't go, and I said, 'This is a mail truck and you can't stop me unless it’s impossible,' and I fooled him, I guess, because he let me go,  says Lund. Now his truck is parked for good and he was honored Wednesday in a ceremony with coworkers, family, and friends at the post office in his hometown of Richfield, per ABC 4 News. But after nearly 70 years behind the wheel, what's next?

"(Nov 8, 2014  3:03 PM) ObamaCare survived a 2012 Supreme Court challenge, but the fight isn't over: Now, justices have agreed to hear an attack on another section of the law. This time, the whole thing hinges on four words, the New York Times editorial board writes. In a subsection, the law says that health care subsidies should come from an exchange  established by the State.  But 36 states didn't set up exchanges, prompting the federal government to do so instead. The legal challenge holds that thanks to those four words, people in those 36 states can't receive subsidies. This is a superficial tactic, the Times notes. The Supreme Court has previously said that it  must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.  The case could come down, once again, to John Roberts, writes Noah Feldman at BloombergView. After fellow conservatives slammed his support for the law's individual mandate in 2012, was he  scarred  enough to follow their lead this time?

She could be released as soon as June 10, CNN reports. Warmus was found guilty of killing Betty Jeanne Solomon; Warmus was a schoolteacher in her twenties having an affair with Solomon's husband, Paul, who was 17 years older. He worked with Warmus at a Westchester County elementary school. Prosecutors said Warmus grew tired of waiting for Solomon to leave his wife, who was shot nine times in her home. The first trial ended in a hung jury, but Warmus was convicted of second-degree murder the next year. The sensational trial spawned TV movies and documentaries, and was widely referred to as the  Fatal Attraction  case after the 1987 Michael Douglas-Glenn Close movie of that name. Prosecutors said Warmus had developed an obsessive attachment to her lover, per the New York Post. After killing his wife, they said, Warmus met Paul Solomon at a hotel bar and had sex with him in his car. She has long claimed to be innocent of the slaying; at an earlier parole hearing, Warmus blamed media attention for her conviction. She has told CNN she was  collateral damage  in a setup; Paul Solomon was a suspect at the time. Warmus said in 2016 that she'd get a different verdict in this era, per CBS:  I'm in prison for 25 years to life because I dated a married man.

Wharton lost control of the truck going around the curve and it overturned, dumping a 7,000-pound metal pipe off the overpass and onto the roof of Escobar's van.

Police say that after a BB&T bank teller accidentally deposited the $120,000 in their account on May 31, the couple spent more than $100,000 between June 3 and June 19, buying an SUV, a camper, a car trailer, and a race car, the Williamsport Sun-Gazette reports. They also allegedly used the money to pay off bills and distribute $15,000 to friends in need.

"(Jan 30, 2013  12:03 AM) A $7.3 million, 12-building compound built by the US Army Corps of Engineers for the Afghan Border Police resembled a ghost town just two months after it was handed over to Afghan authorities, Reuters reports. Inspectors found just 12 personnel at the Kunduz province base camp, which had been built for 175 officers. Most of the buildings appeared unused and equipment like wood-burning stoves had already been dismantled. The investigators had to peer through windows of most of the buildings because the personnel on site only had keys to three of them, ABC reports. The inspectors recommended that the US Army take another look at plans for building other border police facilities to ensure they are appropriately sized. Their report noted that sustaining the Kunduz facility would require people with the skills to maintain electrical generators, fueling stations, and water treatment systems, but there are no plans in place to train anybody.",$7.3M US-Built Afghan Police Camp Sits Nearly Empty,$____M US-Built Afghan Police Camp Sits Nearly Empty,7.3,Copy( 7.3 ),0
"(Jan 11, 2019  7:50 AM) One of two children considered missing after their family's SUV sped off a Northern California cliff in March has been confirmed dead. DNA tests on a partial foot recovered near the crash site in Westport in May confirmed it to be that of 16-year-old Hannah Hart, the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Married parents Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, and three of six adopted children—Markis, 19, Abigail, 14, and Jeremiah, 14—were confirmed dead as the vehicle was discovered on March 26, 2018. Remains of a fourth child, 12-year-old Ciera, were found in April, but Hannah, 16, and Devonte, 15, remained missing. The test on the partial foot, found inside a shoe attached to a pair of jeans, was made possible as the biological mother of Markis, Abigail, and Hannah emerged in October to provide a DNA sample, reports KGW. As the sheriff's department has  not received any indication of Devonte being located elsewhere … the most likely scenario is that he too perished in this incident but the case remains open and active,  per a release. Authorities have described the crash at the cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway as intentional. Jennifer's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit when investigators say she accelerated off the cliff without braking. Sarah and some of the children were sedated, per CNN. The family had set out from Woodland, Wash., days earlier as child-welfare officials looked for them. Reports from officials in three states describe parents who withheld food as punishment for small transgressions, like possessing a penny and laughing at the dinner table.

By 2022, say company officials, McDonald's will no longer buy pork from suppliers who use  gestation crates —narrow stalls in which breeding sows spend much of their lives. The company—which buys some 1% of all pork produced in the US—says that by 2017, it will only purchase pork from sources that have already begun the process of phasing out the stalls, reports the Wall Street Journal. Getting rid of the stalls, which are too small to allow the pigs to turn around in, has long been a key demand of animal welfare groups.  We wish the company planned to get rid of these crates tomorrow, but we understand the logistical challenges involved in making such significant improvements,  said a Humane Society spokesman.

"(Dec 4, 2014  8:14 AM) In July 1994, Sophie Serrano's newborn was put in a hospital incubator as part of the infant's treatment for jaundice. Baby Manon wasn't alone: A second baby girl suffering from jaundice shared the incubator. When the French girls were removed, they were accidentally switched by a nurse whom the Cannes clinic has since blamed, saying she had alcohol issues. The Local and RFI report that the mothers were immediately concerned: Their babies' hair lengths seemed changed, and Serrano pointed out that the baby she had been handed appeared to have darker skin; staff told her the skin difference was a result of the lamps the infant had been exposed to in the incubator. The lack of resemblance only grew with time, to the point that, when Manon was 10, her father got a paternity test and the truth unraveled. Serrano ultimately learned her biological daughter (who has chosen to remain anonymous) was living just 20 miles away, and the two families met. They chose not to switch back the girls, and the meetings petered out.  The social, educational, and cultural differences (between the two families), added to the pain of our unconscious rivalry, took their toll on our relations,  says Serrano. Now the families are suing—again. They initially went after the clinic after the swap surfaced a decade ago, but the statute of limitations rendered their case toothless. But on Tuesday they filed a civil suit against the clinic, two obstetricians, two pediatricians, and a nurse. They want about $15 million dollars, with nearly $4 million earmarked for each girl, and roughly $900,000 going to each of their siblings.

But police say his creepy reign has finally come to an end, reports MLive. Officers say they arrested 54-year-old Steven Pastoor near a highway, naked from the waist down. Investigators with the Kent County Sheriff's Department say he confessed to being the town's serial flasher after his arrest.  We believe him to be responsible for several dozen indecent exposures over the last almost 20 years,  says Lt. Joel Roon, per WOOD-TV. Authorities say the flasher would typically knock on the door or window of a home, or sometimes stand on the side of a road, then masturbate when he had someone's attention. He typically wore a hat and shirt, but no pants. Police say their break came when he began knocking on the same woman's door in 2018. Security cameras at her house helped police identify Pastoor as a suspect, and deputies began surveillance. On March 25, deputies say he was peeping in the windows of an apartment complex, then drove to a parking lot near an interstate.

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have  replenished the account  in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports.

He had body armor, six firearms, and five extra magazines with him during the massacre, the AP reports. Authorities found seven additional firearms inside the shooter's apartment a few miles from Umpqua Community College. All 13 firearms had been purchased legally, and seven of them had been bought by the shooter or his family in the past three years. The 26-year-old shooter was obsessed with guns, enjoyed military history, and left behind an  angry, hate-filled  note, the Los Angeles Times reports, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. Those sources say he was anti-religion, anti-government, and had  white supremacy leanings.  The Oregonian notes that tabloids looking into the shooter's online presence have described him as a  Nazi paraphernalia devotee.  It's been previously reported the shooter targeted Christians during his rampage, described himself as  conservative, Republican  on a dating site, showed support for the IRA on social media, and had recently uploaded a documentary on the Sandy Hook school shooting to a torrent site. He is not believed to have a criminal history.

It's in danger of doing the same today, this time helped along by populated areas taking the water that would normally flow into it. This could lead to momentous problems, as those Mideast populations rely on the salt lake for agriculture, fertilizer, and salt manufacturing.

A prime and much publicized example was that of Michael L. Johnson, now 25, a Lindenwood University wrestling star at the time of his 2013 arrest who is serving 30.5 years for  recklessly  infecting a male partner with HIV and exposing four others to it. Or, was: On Tuesday, a new trial was ordered for Johnson by a Missouri appeals court, which overturned his conviction after finding the trial court did indeed  abuse its discretion  in airing portions of jailhouse phone calls Johnson made that the defense didn't get access to until the morning of the trial's first day. In Missouri's case, not disclosing your HIV status to a partner, as Johnson's accusers alleged and he denied, can be a felony. The ACLU of Missouri is backing Johnson, and as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, flagged what it (and others) perceive to be problems with the conviction and sentence: that the  law under which he is charged is based on outdated science.  Critics of such laws cite significant medical advances and note that while the person with HIV faces legal repercussions, the partner who chose to have unprotected sex does not, reported BuzzFeed last year. BuzzFeed separately reports on what was in those taped calls: Johnson saying his level of confidence that he had alerted his partners to his status was  pretty sure.  The court pointed out it was  the only evidence in the record of Johnson stating to anyone that he was not certain,  making it  highly prejudicial evidence  that Johnson's defense should have had time to prepare to for.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Joe Biden gave an intriguing answer to the question of whether he plans a 2020 White House run.  I haven't decided to run,  he said,  but I've decided I'm not going to decide not to run. We’ll see what happens.  The former vice president said that if it hadn't been for the illness of his son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in May 2015 at age 46, there is  no question  he would have run in 2016.  I had planned on running, and I wasn’t running against Hillary or Bernie or anybody else. Honest to God, I thought that I was the best suited for the moment to be president.  He said he felt that Clinton was a  prisoner of history,  and there never seemed to be any joy in her campaign. Biden's new memoir, Promise Me, Dad, will be released this fall. It covers the time from Beau's 2013 diagnosis to the aftermath of his death. In the Vanity Fair interview, Biden said he kept the option of a run open in 2015 partly to keep Beau—who once told him it was his duty to run—optimistic.  It would have bothered Beau a great deal if I’d not run because of him,  he said. Biden's wife, Jill, said she now often wonders what Beau would have wanted.  He wouldn't want us to grieve forever, although you do,  she said.  So, moving forward, what would Beau want Joe to do? You can probably answer that question.

"(Sep 19, 2016  9:47 AM CDT) For more than 50 years, scientists have been gathering foxes from the Russian wilderness and breeding them, picking the most human-friendly to mate to domesticate the supposedly untamable animals, much as dogs once were, Phys.org reports. And it looks like the project the BBC says was started by Dmitry Belyae and his intern, Lyudmila Trut, has been a success: By the fourth generation of foxes, the animals were acting much like socialized dogs, wagging their tails and seeking human contact, and they'd physically changed, too, with droopier ears, shorter legs and snouts, and higher serotonin levels, which may have dampened aggressiveness. In the late 1950s Belyae and Trut set out to domesticate a species from the ground up—in a country that Live Science notes banned the study of genetics in 1948, with severe punishments for those who flouted the law. In the beginning, the researchers pretended they were breeding foxes for their fur (and they did kill for fur those foxes that weren't docile enough to continue mating for their real experiment). What's interesting is that the foxes on the farm weren't  tamed,  per se, which is learned behavior not passed down to the next generation, Popular Science explained in 2013. Rather, a 2009 paper by Trut (Belyae died in 1985, and Trut, now in her 80s, has been running the project since) notes that the meticulously selective breeding led to the neurological and endocrinal changes the foxes underwent, per Discover. Now that the foxes have been domesticated, Trut's next task is to isolate the genes that are altered during this process. Read the BBC story for a fascinating look at the experiment, which as of last month involved 340 foxes.

The announcement was made through an army statement broadcast on Syrian state TV shortly after the last four buses carrying fighters left through the Ramousseh crossing, reports AP. Western Aleppo erupted in celebratory gunfire seen on Syrian TV, which showed uniformed soldiers and civilians shouting slogans in support of President Bashar Assad.

Nixon rose to prominence during the '60s and '70s, and NPR describes her as one of the only powerful women in the entertainment industry during that era. Just like Nixon herself, two of her more famous creations were well-loved and and long-lived: All My Children ran for over four decades, while One Life To Live aired for 44 seasons. Both ended in 2011. Nixon was well-known for using her shows to draw attention to controversial social issues. Her plots addressed everything from cancer to abortion to homosexuality, issues often elided by many TV shows of the era. As the New York Times notes, Susan Lucci's character on All My Children was the first on TV to have a legal abortion—in 1973, just after Roe v. Wade.  I wasn't trying to change the genre, I was just trying to write what I thought, what was interesting to me,  Nixon told NPR in 2010. The Washington Post asserts that she  quietly made soap operas relevant,  noting that a story line she wrote about a Guiding Light character's uterine cancer in 1962 is considered the first health plot in a daytime drama.

The answer: before our kids can  walk or talk,  as a press release puts it. Philadelphia researchers surveyed 370 parents during a two-month period in fall 2014 at a pediatric clinic  that serves an urban, low income, minority community,  they write. The parents had kids between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, and most owned tablets (83%) and/or smartphones (77%).

In fact, by the age of one year, 14% of kids logged usage of at least an hour a day. Further, the survey responses indicate  most children are using [mobile devices] by age two years,  though Time points to the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation that kids under two not have exposure. Why is it happening? The researchers did ask when the children used the devices, and got these answers: while running errands (60%), while the parent was doing chores (73%), when the child needed to be calmed (65%), and to put the child to sleep (29%).

Fox—which didn't host any Democratic primary debates in 2016, but hosted town hall meetings with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders—had sent proposals to the DNC to host one of the 12 primary debates scheduled so far, the Guardian reports. Fox said in a statement that it hoped the DNC would reconsider the decision, which would affect respected anchors like Chris Wallace, Bret Baier, and Martha MacCallum, Mediaite reports. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to retaliate on the network's behalf.  Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate,  he tweeted.

But is a Britney comeback possible in the new world of pop, where Ke$ha (who can certainly  offer a few dance hooks in a girl-gone-wild package ) and Lady Gaga (who  has almost single-handedly reinvented the blonde dance beast aesthetic ) have swept in and taken over the spot once held by Brit, wonders Mary Elizabeth Williams on Salon.  As a colleague mused recently, Britney after Gaga is like going back to the greatest bar in your midsize hometown after a year in Manhattan. It's still comfortable; it just doesn't seem as eye-popping,  Williams continues. It might help if Britney offered up some introspection on her new album, but if the single is any indication, all we’re going to get is the same old  glitter and earworms and aggressive come-ons.  Of course,  she could keep pumping out coolly efficient disco beats from now until the apocalypse … but as she veers toward 30, she can't keep partying like it's 2001 forever.

AMC Theaters, the chain their cinema spawned, plans to charge the same price when it reopens theaters next week. The company says it will reopen around 100 locations Aug. 20 in cities including Atlanta, Dallas, and Miami, with 15-cent tickets on opening day for legacy titles including Black Panther, Ghostbusters, and The Empire Strikes Back, Variety reports.

"(Jan 31, 2016  5:54 AM) American and Mexican authorities cooperated in a daylong cross-border raid that resulted in the arrest of 24 alleged high-level members of Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel, reports the AP. The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Ariz., which sits on the Mexican border. Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helped Mexican authorities nab the cartel members, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the US border, ICE rep Gillian Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand.  This operation was conducted with utmost secrecy to maintain the element of surprise and to ensure the safety of the Mexican law enforcement officers executing it,  Christensen said, per CNN. ICE helped Mexican federal police into the US to keep them safe during the operation, Christensen said. The sting also netted the seizure of several assault-type weapons and hundreds of pounds of drugs.  ICE applauds the government of Mexico for their bold action in taking down this criminal organization and for their continued pressure on the Sinaloa Cartel throughout Mexico,  Christensen said. The arrests are the latest blow to the Sinaloa Cartel after the arrest of El Chapo on Jan. 8. The 24 people arrested Friday have not been identified.

"(Nov 5, 2014  1:44 PM) The obvious big winner in last night's election is Mitch McConnell. But observers see two less-obvious victors in Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie. At Vox, for example, Ezra Klein writes that  a more Democratic year could have led to some new stars who might have been able to challenge  Clinton in 2016. The GOP wave took care of that. Andrew Romano at Yahoo goes further, arguing that  almost everything  about the results— the map, the math and the legislative morass that lies ahead in the run-up to 2016—suggests that the former first lady and secretary of state will have a better next two years than the party currently guzzling champagne.  One of Romano's points is that in 2016, the Senate races up for grabs look more favorable to Democrats, which should give her an electoral boost. As for Christie, as head of the Republican Governors' Association, he can take a big share of the credit for GOP gubernatorial candidates' great success last night.  He can now argue not only that he has personally won elections in a blue state but that he led a bunch of other Republicans to win hard elections in blue states,  writes Klein.  That's going to be a powerful argument to make to Republicans in 2016.  One more observation on Clinton, via Jonathan Chait at New York: Given that the GOP now controls the House and Senate, he writes that she is now  the only thing standing between a Republican Party even more radical than George W. Bush’s version and unfettered control of American government.","2 More Election Winners: Christie, Clinton","____ More Election Winners: Christie, Clinton",2,Trans( two ),1

Southern Cross Austereo will fork over a minimum of $525,000 to a memorial fund, reports Reuters; it had suspended all advertising in the wake of Saldanha's death, but will resume Thursday. Legal experts, meanwhile, tell the AP that 2Day FM could face charges for airing a private conversation.

"(Oct 17, 2013  6:58 PM CDT) The US Justice Department today brought fresh charges against four former Blackwater Worldwide security contractors, resurrecting an internationally charged case over a deadly 2007 shooting on the streets of Baghdad. A new jury indictment charges the men in a shooting that inflamed anti-American sentiment in Iraq and heightened diplomatic sensitivities amid an ongoing war. The men were hired to guard US diplomats. The guards are accused of opening fire in busy Nisoor Square on Sept. 16, 2007. Seventeen Iraqi civilians died, including women and children. Prosecutors say the heavily armed Blackwater convoy used machine guns and grenades in an unprovoked attack. Defense lawyers argue their clients are innocent men who were ambushed by Iraqi insurgents. The guards were charged with manslaughter and weapons violations in 2008, but a federal judge the following year dismissed the case, ruling the Justice Department withheld evidence from a grand jury and violated the guards' constitutional rights. The dismissal outraged many Iraqis, who said it showed Americans consider themselves above the law. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Baghdad in 2010, expressed his  personal regret  for the shootings. A federal appeals court reinstated the case in 2011, saying now-retired Judge Ricardo Urbina had wrongly interpreted the law. Prosecutors again presented evidence before a grand jury, and US District Judge Royce Lamberth gave the Justice Department until Monday to decide what to do with the case.",New Charges in 2007 Blackwater Shootings,New Charges in ____ Blackwater Shootings,2007,Copy( 2007 ),0

"(Sep 3, 2019  6:18 PM CDT) Cancer is now the No. 1 cause of death in wealthy countries, killing twice as many people as heart disease—which remains the leading cause of death for middle-aged adults worldwide, Reuters reports. A new study finds that this  epidemiological transition  is at play in  rich world  countries including Sweden, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Poland, and Turkey; researchers theorize that could be due to improvements in prevention and treatment of heart disease in those countries, CNN reports.  As cardiovascular disease declines in many countries, cancer mortality is likely to become the leading cause of death in the future  across the globe, the study's senior author says, per Fox News. Overall, cardiovascular disease (a group of ailments including heart failure, angina, heart attack, and stroke) kills 40% of all adults aged 35-70 worldwide, with cancer in the No. 2 spot at 26%, the study found. But in high-income countries, the prevalence of cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medication has brought cardiovascular disease rates down significantly. In middle-income and low-income countries, researchers found heart disease medication use was much lower. Among the study's limitations, however, is the fact that it did not look at every country in the world. The US was not included, but a study last year found that while heart disease was more likely to kill those in low-income US counties, cancer was more likely to kill those in high-income counties.",There's a New No. 1 Killer in the Rich World,There's a New No. ____ Killer in the Rich World,1,Copy( 1 ),0

But it didn’t work; as we learned yesterday, she and her four grown daughters exercised their family veto power and nixed a Daniels 2012 run. Insiders say Cheri simply couldn’t come to terms with the scrutiny of her marriage and mothering; she and Mitch divorced in 1993 and remarried in 1997—and Cheri married another man in California in the years between. She was also facing criticism from some who believed she  abandoned  her daughters during that time—they lived with their father—a claim Mitch staunchly denied in a separate statement yesterday. Though one source says the couple could have spun the marital issue— If you like a love story with a happy ending you’ll like ours —the truth is that many GOP insiders didn’t realize what went on in Daniels’ past until the stories started coming out recently, and Cheri apparently wasn’t ready for those stories to continue.

The New York Times reports that this has been worst summer for the film industry in North America since 1997. Ticket sales from May through August are expected to come in at $3.9 billion, down 15% from last year. While movies such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Angelina Jolie's Maleficient, and Scarlett Johansson's Lucy did relatively well, supposed blockbusters such as Edge of Tomorrow and Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn't meet expectations, and sequels in general didn't seem to have the lure they once did. Studios will surely counter that ticket sales must be counted worldwide now, not just in North America, but  what they do not often mention is that overseas ticket sales are often less profitable,  writes Brooks Barnes.  In China, for instance, as little as 25 cents of every box office dollar comes back to Hollywood; in the United States, it’s 50 percent.  So is this a sign of things to come?

One other leading theory: All eight lived at the same nursing facility and might have consumed something there that made them ill, reports KTVU. As of Monday, all but one of the five hospitalized patients had been released.

"(Apr 24, 2019  8:49 AM CDT) Canadian trash has been sitting at a port in the Philippines for more than five years, and President Rodrigo Duterte wants it gone—or else. Duterte's word choices tend to grab headlines, and this instance is no exception:  I'll give a warning to Canada maybe next week that they better pull that [trash] out,  he said Tuesday.  We'll declare war against them, we can handle them anyway.  CNN reports the issue is the 2013 and 2014 shipment of 2,450 tons of what were supposed to be recyclable plastic scraps. But inspectors in Manila say what was in the 103 containers couldn't be processed—the AP reports there was reportedly plastic bottles inside, but also things like used adult diapers and other household trash—and some of the containers are still sitting there. The BBC reports the shipment was made by a private company based in Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a 2015 visit to the country that Canada could not legally force that company to act. The Canadian Press reports Canada's efforts have mainly centered around getting the Philippines to just accept the trash. In 2016, a Filipino court ruled it had to go back to Canada. Trudeau has previously said he is  very much engaged in finding a solution.  Duterte offered one: He said he'd bring the garbage back himself.",Trash Shipped to Philippines in 2013 Leads to Threat of War,Trash Shipped to Philippines in ____ Leads to Threat of War,2013,Copy( 2013 ),0

The senator, who is considering running for president again in 2020, unveiled legislation Thursday that would both expand and increase the estate tax, raising trillions. From Bloomberg, Business Insider, and the Hill: Sanders said in a statement that the bill, which he's calling the  For the 99.8% Act,  would only impact the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans, and would raise up to $2.2 trillion from just the families of the 588 US billionaires whose combined net worth is more than $3 trillion.  Our bill does what the American people want by substantially increasing the estate tax on the wealthiest families in this country and dramatically reducing wealth inequality,  he said.  From a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little.  He added that the top estate tax rate was 77% from 1941 to 1976.

The victims include at least 21 children and four adults killed in the collapse of the Enrique Rabsamen primary school in Mexico City's Coapa neighborhood, the Guardian reports. On Tuesday evening, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the site, where rescuers occasionally paused their search to listen for voices in the rubble, the AP reports. The president said at least 30 children and eight adults are still missing. In a video message released later Tuesday, Pena Nieto urged Mexicans to stay calm.  The priority at this moment is to keep rescuing people who are still trapped and to give medical attention to the injured people,  he said. Civilian volunteers have joined rescue workers at many sites. Authorities say the quake collapsed at least 44 buildings in Mexico City alone, the Telegraph reports. It hit on the anniversary of a 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. Earlier in the day, workplaces and schools across Mexico City had marked the date by holding earthquake readiness drills.

Police say ex-cop Norris Greenhouse Jr., 23, and Marksville police Lt. Derrick Stafford, 32, were moonlighting as Marksville city marshals when they fired into a vehicle driven by Jeremy's father, Chris Few, who was unarmed, reports NBC News, which notes that the charges carry a mandatory punishment of life in prison without parole.

"(Feb 24, 2016  1:18 AM) It's a huge blow for Johnson & Johnson, and a huge win for the family of a woman who blamed the company's products for her ovarian cancer. In St. Louis on Monday, a jury awarded $72 million to the family of Alabama's Jacqueline Fox: $10 million in actual damages and $62 million—$1 million for every year that she lived—in punitive damages, Courthouse News reports. Fox, who died in October but testified in a video deposition, said she used the company's talc-based Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products for feminine hygiene for 35 years. The family's lawyers said the company covered up evidence the products could cause cancer and the jury agreed, finding Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence, and conspiracy, reports Reuters. The evidence included internal memos that lawyers argued showed that Johnson & Johnson was aware of the link between talc and ovarian cancer for more than 30 years but covered it up. Fox's son, Marvin Salter, became the plaintiff after her death. He tells the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Johnson & Johnson was a company name he had trusted.  My reaction was disbelief,  he says.  How can a company have known about this relationship between talc and ovarian cancer since the 1970s and not disclosed it?  Fox's case was the first to go to court, but there are around 1,200 similar ones in Missouri and New Jersey. The company says  the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence  and it plans to appeal the ruling.

Some 20 high school students were killed at the Kintampo waterfalls when a tree or trees (media reports differ on the number) fell at the top of the falls and toppled on them below, an official tells the AFP.  They were swimming in the river when there was a storm, a windy atmosphere that had uprooted some of the trees,  says a national fire service spokesman.  A huge tree fell at the top when the rains began and crashed the revelers,  a witness tells Starr FM. Rescue teams worked with chainsaws to clear those who were trapped.

"(Aug 20, 2014  2:15 PM CDT) A 200-year-old bottle of alcohol found in a shipwreck at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is still suitable for drinking—if you can get past its stink. The stoneware bottle, emblazoned with the name of a mineral water named Selters, was found off the Polish coast in the Gulf of Gdansk last year, LiveScience reports. Preliminary lab tests suggest at least a bit of the water was left in the bottle before it was refilled with liquor by boozy sailors, UPI speculates. That liquor may be a type of gin called jenever and it was diluted with water that matches Selters. Should archaeologists succumb to temptation and sip a little of the gin, the old alcohol won't poison them, but  it does not smell particularly good,  says one scientist. Selters soda water comes from the Taunus Mountains in Germany and was found 1,000 years ago, LiveScience explains. The bottle from the Gdansk wreck is from the early 19th century and originated 25 miles from Selters Springs; it was one of 2 million likely sold in the region's village shops, adds Science and Scholarship in Poland. The spring went dry in the early 19th century, but a new one was found in 1896; the water is still sold as a luxury product. The stinky concoction in the stoneware bottle will undergo more tests, as per UPI. LiveScience offers these pictures of the discovery.

"(Mar 18, 2016  6:50 PM CDT) Former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan was awarded $115 million by a jury Friday in his lawsuit against Gawker, which published a sex tape featuring the Hulkster in 2012, the AP reports. It's $15 million more than he was asking. According to Ars Technica, which points out punitive damages could still be added to the total, the loss in court could be a  life-threatening event  for Gawker, which has around 250 employees. Gawker published a video of Hogan having sex with the wife of his friend Todd Clem—aka Bubba the Love Sponge—made at Clem's insistence. Clem had recorded the encounter, possibly without Hogan's knowledge. Hogan cried when the jury revealed its findings after nearly six hours of deliberations, CNN reports. In their closing arguments Friday, Hogan's lawyers argued the video was a violation of his privacy.  Gawker took a secretly recorded sex tape and put it on the Internet,  the AP quotes Hogan's attorneys. Gawker's attorneys argued the site had a  legitimate news reason  for publishing the video as a  commentary on the ordinariness of celebrity sex videos.  One of the website's lawyers went on to warn that if Hogan's suit was successful,  the Internet as we know it will cease to exist.  In addition to Gawker, the jury found founder Nick Denton and former editor Albert Daulerio (who made headlines for saying he'd consider publishing the sex tape of anyone over the age of 5) personally liable. Gawker says it only made about $11,000 from publishing the sex tape and took outside investment for the first time to cover potential costs from the trial.",Hulk Hogan Gets $115M in Gawker Sex Tape Lawsuit,Hulk Hogan Gets $____M in Gawker Sex Tape Lawsuit,115,Copy( 115 ),0

"(Nov 8, 2015  6:40 PM) Looks increasingly like last week's horrific Russian plane crash in Egypt—which killed all 224 passengers and crew—was caused by a bomb. An Egyptian investigator tells Reuters that his team is  90% sure it was a bomb  but refused to explain the uncertainty.  The indications and analysis so far of the sound on the black box indicate it was a bomb,  he says. His team's top investigator, Ayman al-Muqaddam, said yesterday that the plane was apparently on auto-pilot when it broke apart on its route from an Egyptian tourist resort to St. Petersburg on Oct. 31. A last-second noise heard on the cockpit recorder could have been a bomb, he said, unless it was metal fatigue, overheating batteries, or a fuel explosion. Meanwhile, CNN reports that a top US official calls the bomb theory  99.9% certain  and another says it's  likely.  And Rep. Peter King, who helms the Homeland Security subcommittee on terrorism and intelligence, tells the New York Times that  right now all the evidence points in that direction.  That would jibe with a claim from the Sinai affiliate of ISIS that it brought down the plane, and ISIS chatter picked up by the US and Britain to that effect, though US officials say such chatter is pretty typical. Regardless, Russia and Britain have already repatriated thousands of tourists from Egypt as a precautionary measure.

"(Apr 3, 2020  3:05 AM CDT) President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spent Thursday clashing over the administration's coronavirus response, with Schumer criticizing the White House's  tardiness and inadequacy  and Trump firing back in more personal terms. Trump, who was impeached by the House in December, called the Democrat a  bad  senator in what USA Today calls a  notably nasty  letter and told him New York would have been better prepared if Schumer had spent less time on  your ridiculous impeachment hoax.  The back-and-forth began early in the day, when Schumer wrote in a letter to Trump that the president should appoint a  czar like a military or logistics expert to lead the effort to make and get the supplies where they’re needed.  The  federal leadership void has left America with an ugly spectacle in which states and cities are literally fending for themselves, often in conflict and competition with each other,  Schumer wrote, per Politico. Trump told Schumer, whose state has the most COVID-19 cases in the country, to  stop complaining.   It wouldn’t matter if you got ten times what was needed, it would never be good enough,  Trump tweeted. Schumer's office later told CNN the senator had spoken to Trump on Thursday afternoon, and that Trump told Schumer he had written a  very nasty letter  to Schumer but  would try to stop it from going out.  Schumer told MSNBC Thursday night that he was  appalled  by the president's letter.

"(Aug 29, 2011  11:34 AM CDT) The US has basically flushed $30 billion down the toilet, according to a bipartisan commission looking into the money spent on contracts and grants in Iraq and Afghanistan. It found that at least one out of every six dollars spent in the last 10 years has been money wasted. In a report to be submitted to Congress Wednesday, the commission finds that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were begun  without adequate planning or contract-management personnel to handle the enormous scale and numbers of contracts,  write the group’s heads. And just as much money could go to waste all over again if the countries’ governments can't or won't maintain US-funded programs after we leave: The report cites $300 million we spent on a power plant that the Afghan government lacks the funds and expertise to run as an example.  Poor planning, inadequate competition, lax accountability, and subpar performance, or outright misconduct by some contractors and federal employees  are among the issues the report confronts. And It’s not just money that has been wasted: Poor contract management also hurts  support for military, diplomatic, and development efforts  and helps breed corruption, write Christopher Shays and Michael Thibault in the Washington Post.

Now, almost 77 years later, the ship's resting place has finally been found. An expedition crew funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen located the shipwreck near the Solomon Islands late last month, NPR reports. The ship's remains were found almost 17,500 feet below the ocean surface with the help of naval reports from the era, scans from a deep-sea sonar drone, and a dive from an autonomous underwater vehicle. To protect the wreck, the exact location will be kept secret. Some 140 sailors died in the battle, though most of the 2,200 crew members were able to abandon the ship after it was badly damaged by Japanese bombers and torpedo planes.

The most recent accident occurred this week, when a Chevy Equinox came through one of the walls and missed Leigh, who was watching the Colts game in her living room with her husband, by less than a foot.  This time I thought she was dead, five inches away from it,  Tim McCall tells WTHR.  I had no idea how something didn't hit her.

Golge, one of more than a dozen Americans detained after a failed coup in 2016, was sentenced to more than seven years on terrorism charges in Feb. 2018, which was later reduced to five years on appeal, the New York Times reports.

Authorities say the attack does not appear to be drug cartel-related, though analysts say the line between common and organized crime in the resort city has become extremely blurred after years of drug war carnage, reports the CBC. Acapulco Mayor Luis Walton swiftly condemned the attack, admitting it would hurt the city's image, but later apologized for saying  it happens anywhere in the world,  Reuters reports. The mayor  very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts,  his office said in a statement. The victims, who range in age from 20 to 34, are now under the protection of Mexican authorities and are receiving consular assistance.",6 Tourists Gang-Raped in Acapulco,____ Tourists Gang-Raped in Acapulco,6,Copy( 6 ),0
"(May 25, 2017  12:03 AM CDT) Army tanks packed with soldiers have rolled into a southern Philippine city to try to restore control after militants linked to ISIS launched a violent siege. Thousands of civilians have been fleeing Marawi, a city of some 200,000 people, the AP reports. At least 21 people have died in fighting that erupted late Tuesday, when the army raided the Marawi hideout of Isnilon Hapilon. Hapilon is on Washington's list of most-wanted terrorists and has a $5 million bounty on his head. But the operation quickly went wrong as the militants called in reinforcements. The city was still largely sealed off Thursday, although automatic gunfire and explosions could be heard and plumes of black smoke rose from the direction of the city center as air force helicopters swooped overhead. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has declared martial law in the Mindanao group of islands and has said he's considering expanding it nationwide.

"(Jun 22, 2015  8:10 AM CDT) Peder Winstrup is remarkably well-preserved for a man who died in 1679, and while researchers expected the mummified corpse of the former bishop of Lund would yield fascinating information on the 17th century, they didn't expect a CT scan to reveal another body. But when his coffin was removed from the Swedish city's cathedral, scientists were amazed to discover a tiny body, that of a fetus five to six months old, had been concealed at his feet, tucked away in a layer of herbs, the Guardian reports. DNA tests will be performed to see if the premature baby is related to the bishop, but researchers suspect that it may have been born illegitimately to a member of his household, who placed it in the coffin to ensure it had a better resting place than the unsanctified ground such babies were buried in. The director of Lund's history museum tells Radio Sweden that researchers were almost as surprised to find that the bishop, who was buried on a mattress stuffed with juniper berries and other herbs, still had his internal organs, making him a  time capsule  from 1679 and  one of the best-preserved human bodies from the 1600s,  per Lund University.  Everyone thought the bishop was embalmed, in which case, there are no internal organs left in the body,  says the museum director. But he apparently  dried out naturally,  according to the university, the result of a winter burial, constant airflow, the plants in his coffin, and his lean body, among other factors. Even the bishop's clothes are in pretty good shape, researchers say. After more tests are carried out on the two bodies, they will be reburied together, the Guardian reports.

This man was never sick,  she tells AP. Vigoda might be best known for his role as detective Phil Fish in the 1970s sitcom Barney Miller, but his big break came before that when Francis Ford Coppola cast him as Sal Tessio in the Godfather.

Steven Pressman is out to change that with a new book called 50 Children: One Ordinary American Couple’s Extraordinary Rescue Mission into the Heart of Nazi Germany, reports the Christian Science Monitor. (Pressman also made a documentary that aired on HBO.) The short version is that the Krauses lived in Philadelphia in 1939 and grew increasingly alarmed about reports of atrocities against Jews emerging from Europe. But unlike most, they decided to do something about it. They sailed overseas, entered Nazi Germany despite the danger to Jews like themselves, and managed to secure the release of 50 Jewish children whose families wanted desperately for them to make it to the US. They escorted the kids back to America—having to overcome friction in their own country over immigration worries and anti-Semitism—and put them up in a summer camp in Collegeville, Pa., notes a review of the book at the San Jose Mercury News. All were either placed in American homes or eventually reunited with their own families. The reason the story is so unknown? Afterward, the Krauses never spoke of what they did, says Pressman.

"(Jun 5, 2017  3:24 PM CDT) Apple is transplanting its digital assistant Siri into an internet-connected speaker that will become the company's first new product in more than two years, the AP reports. The HomePod speaker unveiled at Apple's annual conference for app developers Monday is similar to devices that rivals Amazon and Google have already been selling, though Apple says it's giving more emphasis to sound quality, not just smarts. It's no surprise, but there's integration with the Apple Music online subscription. Besides playing music, HomePod will help people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be the voice assistant responding to requests for information and other help around the house. It's Apple's first new device since the company released the Apple Watch in April 2015. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the US, UK, and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180 and Google sells its Home speaker for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, have helped plant the seeds for a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the US are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year.

"(Apr 18, 2014  5:36 PM CDT) How would a cabbie manage to cross the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in New York City more than 3,000 times without paying a dime in tolls? Pretty easily, it turns out. Police say Rodolfo Sanchez figured out that if he tailgated the law-abiding, toll-paying car ahead of him closely enough, he could sneak though before the barrier came back down, reports the New York Times. Authorities allege that Sanchez did exactly that on every trip for nearly two years and saved himself more than $28,000 in tolls. Now, however, the 69-year-old faces grand larceny charges and seven years in prison if convicted, reports CBS New York. Authorities finally caught on to the scheme when they noticed that a particular EZ Pass with no money in its account crossed the bridge over and over and over for free. It wasn't registered to Sanchez—he may have used it as a decoy—but investigators were able to use the device's tracking data to crack the case.

Dan Suski, 30, and Kate Suski, 39, were out at sea earlier this week on a chartered fishing boat when its electrical system conked out. As the boat took on water, the siblings jumped overboard with the captain and first mate and watched as the boat sank. The Suskis decided to swim for land, and they made it, barely—but only after somewhere between 12 to 14 hours. Even then, they had to spend the night unsheltered, then hike through thick brush until they finally found another human. The captain and first mate, meanwhile, were rescued after spending nearly 24 hours in the water.

Three  very high value  paintings were stolen just before midnight Saturday from an art gallery at Oxford University's Christ Church college. Chief among them was A Soldier On Horseback by Anthony Van Dyck, described by the BBC as a  17th-century master  who was a  leading court painter  during the reign of King Charles I. Salvator Rosa's A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying A Plan and Annibale Carracci's A Boy Drinking were also taken from the Christ Church Picture Gallery.

The final amount in cuts would match the amount the debt ceiling is raised. Congress would have until Dec. 23 to agree to the additional deficit reductions—which could include further spending cuts or tax increases.

"(Mar 13, 2018  8:07 AM CDT) A study on  ubiquitous but insidious  lead exposure is being deemed a  big deal  after researchers found a link between lead exposure and the deaths of around a quarter-million Americans annually from heart disease. In what USA Today says is the first study using a nationally representative sample to look at how low-level lead exposure is tied to deaths in the US, scientists kept tabs on more than 14,000 adults who took a national health survey between 1988 and 1994, then again in 2011. After looking at how many people died during this period—about 4,400 in total, 1,800 of those from cardiovascular disease—the study in the Lancet Public Health journal found about 256,000 deaths each year could be tied to lead exposure. The effects of lead on heart health had previously been thought to be much lower, especially at low levels of lead exposure, study lead author Bruce Lanphear tells CNN. Dr. Philip Landrigan, a Mount Sinai epidemiologist not involved with the study, explains that lead—which can show up in old water pipes, paint in older homes, industrial sites, plane fuel, and even certain foods—damages blood vessels' epithelial cells, which then ups the risk of plaque building up, possibly leading to a heart attack. The scientists also looked at all kinds of deaths, not just ones caused by heart disease, and found lead was tied to more than 410,000 US deaths annually—about 10 times more than what was previously believed to be the case, and not far off from the 480,000 smokers who die each year. The good news: Today's lead-exposure levels are much lower, meaning the next generation should hopefully see a lower death rate linked to lead. Consumer Reports offers some tips to keep you and your family safe.

Barr may insist he's not working at the president's behest, but his  actions in doing the President’s personal bidding unfortunately speak louder than his words,  reads the statement, which CNN reports was signed mostly by former prosecutors with the department who have worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The constitution requires the Justice Department to be impartial, to treat all Americans equally under the law, and to prosecute free of any outside influence. DOJ lawyers  stand for the proposition that political interference in the conduct of a criminal prosecution is anathema to the Department’s core mission and to its sacred obligation to ensure equal justice under the law,  the statement reads.  And yet, President Trump and Attorney General Barr have openly and repeatedly flouted this fundamental principle, most recently in connection with the sentencing of President Trump’s close associate, Roger Stone,  the statement continues. When the department took the unheard-of step to overrule the prosecutors on the Stone case, it was clearly giving  preferential treatment  to a Trump confidant, the statement says.  Such behavior is a grave threat to the fair administration of justice,  it continues.  Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.

The Fort Worth, Texas company said today that it was also having discussions to sell all of its remaining assets. RadioShack Corp. introduced one of the first mass-market personal computers and used to be the go-to stop for consumers' home electronics needs. But it struggled as shoppers increasingly shifted to making purchases online and growth in its wireless business slowed. It has suffered years of losses. The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of its shares on Monday and sought to delist it. The NYSE requires companies meet certain market capitalization thresholds to remain on the exchange. RadioShack had warned of a possible bankruptcy in September, but received rescue financing that kept it afloat. Still, its CEO recently cautioned the chain might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay in business. RadioShack worked hard on its turnaround efforts, hiring Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca as its CEO and former Treasury Department adviser Harry Wilson as chief revitalization officer. It also developed relationships with popular brands like Beats Audio and redesigned almost half of its US locations—some 2,000 stores—in an effort to entice younger shoppers.

"(May 30, 2013  11:32 AM CDT) New Jersey sent nearly $24 million in taxpayer money to prisoners in the form of unemployment, welfare, pension, and other benefits, reports the New York Times. An audit released yesterday uncovered 20,000 prisoners who received benefit money between July 2009 and April 2011, including tales such as one man who collected $39,000 in unemployment benefits while locked up for a drug offense—despite a state law requiring that beneficiaries be  available for work.  State officials and  a lack of adequate internal controls  are to blame, according to the state comptroller's report.  Suffice it to say that when thousands of inmates are collecting unemployment checks from behind bars, there is a serious gap in program oversight,  the comptroller said, adding that some agency programs just didn't check to see if recipients were in state or county prison, while others relied on newspaper reports rather than available databases.

"(Mar 2, 2014  12:52 PM) Every time you read about an abandoned newborn and think,  what kind of depraved human being would do that? , you're having exactly the same thought 14-year-old Dave Hickman did on Sept. 22, 1955, when he found a days-old baby girl left to die in the Indiana field where he was squirrel hunting. After hearing a cooing noise, he stumbled upon the infant, cold, wet, and  laying in the brush and sticks ... looking up me,  says Hickman, who now lives in Tennessee. But unlike anyone who casually read the headline, Hickman says he thought about that little girl every day for the last 58 years, and as the Palladium-Item reports, he finally got serious about tracking her down in December. The infant was dubbed Roseann Wayne by nurses, her surname coming from Wayne County, where Hickman found her. She was adopted by a couple, and was even brought to say goodbye to Hickman, but then disappeared. Eventually Hickman hooked up with a retired Wayne County sheriff, who says he talked to some 75 people aged  80 or better  before he hit pay dirt and found Baby Roseann in California. She is 58-year-old Mary Ellen Suey—mom to two, grandmother to four—and, as Hickman says,  a very lovely lady.  The two have talked by phone and plan to meet in May.  There was an instant bond between Ellen and me,  says Hickman.  It's almost as if she was my baby.  Says Suey:  He's my hero.

Had his death occurred five years earlier it likely would have gone quietly unnoticed. But in 2008, Karason went on the Today show to talk to Matt Lauer about something most unusual: his blue skin. Karason says he started turning blue a decade and a half ago, the result of applying and ingesting silver. He was trying to treat dermatitis on his face and had used what the Christian Post describes as  a silver-based remedy  along with colloidal silver. NBC News explains that the latter was something he drank, and describes it as a liquid Karason made himself that has silver particles suspended in it. He consumed 10 ounces a day, notes ABC News. It was outdated medicine, however: Though silver had been used as medicine for thousands of years, it was effectively replaced by penicillin in the 1930s, and was banned by the FDA because it causes argyria, in which silver amasses in the skin and organs and stays there. It causes the blue coloration. The Post notes that Karason was known by some children as  Papa Smurf,  but bristled when adults used the term, according to his estranged wife. In addition to his troubled marriage, Karason fought prostate cancer and health problems, and struggled financially. He noted in a 2012 interview,  People are reluctant to hire blue people.

"(Sep 27, 2017  10:50 AM CDT) Encountering a foot-and-a-half-long rat might be nightmarish for some, but for Tyrone Lavery, it heralded a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. Back in 2010, the mammalogist was exploring the Solomon Islands when he heard locals describe  vika,  a giant tree-dwelling rat with teeth powerful enough to break open coconuts. Reports of such a rat had circulated for decades. But though he searched for years, Lavery only managed to find some rather large rat poop, reports the Guardian. In 2016, however, Lavery was able to examine a rat that had died after falling from a tree downed by loggers and knew immediately his quest for  vika  was over. Uromys vika, as it has now been named, is the first new rat species discovered in the Solomon Islands in 80 years. At 18 inches long and 2.2 pounds, the specimen within the family of mosaic-tailed rats is about four times the size of a common rat. It's  pretty spectacular,  says Lavery, per a release. And though  it was just so hard to find,  the researcher is happy his persistence paid off.  If we hadn't discovered it now, it might never have gotten discovered  due to the logging of the rainforest canopy the rat inhabits through use of its scaly tail and clawed back feet, Lavery says, per National Geographic. He also describes the rat's ability to chew holes in tree nuts. Given that Lavery believes the species' total habitat is 31 square miles, his paper in the Journal of Mammalogy requests that the rat be immediately classified as critically endangered.

A witness tells KCRA that the chase started after suspects left a Bank of America branch with rifles held to the heads of three terrified women as police looked on.  These poor women, they were screaming, they were so distraught, so scared,  the witness says. The chase lasted around 45 minutes, and a witness says the shootout after the stolen SUV became disabled at an intersection  sounded like five minutes of straight gunfire.  Both of the hostages who were thrown from the vehicle have been hospitalized with gunshot wounds. After the shootout ended, police found one suspect and one hostage dead inside the SUV. A second suspect died later in the hospital and a third suspect is in the hospital with gunshot wounds. The city's chief of police says the dead hostage was a bank customer used as a human shield during the shootout, the AP reports.

Information was slow to reach the capital of Kathmandu, but officials and aid workers say they expect the death toll will almost certainly rise. Rescue helicopters were sent to districts northeast of the capital of Kathmandu, where landslides and buildings collapsed by the magnitude-7.3 quake may have left people buried; a government official named the Sindhupalchowk and Dolkha districts as the hardest hit. Today's quake was deeper than the 7.8-magnitude quake that rocked the country on April 25, coming from a depth of 11.5 miles versus the earlier one at 9.3 miles. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage. The Guardian explains by way of a British seismologist that in terms of the  amplitude  of the quake (meaning  the distance the ground moves ), the 7.8-magnitude quake was about five times more powerful than today's. As for today's quake, it was followed closely by at least six strong aftershocks, according to the US Geological Survey.

"(Nov 18, 2020  8:29 AM) With a 50% drop in passengers taking to the skies in 2020, there's no better time to overhaul an industry responsible for dangerous carbon emissions, according to researchers.  If you want to resolve climate change … then we should start at the top, where a few 'super emitters' contribute massively to global warming,  Stefan Gössling of Sweden's Linnaeus University tells the Guardian.  We should see the crisis as an opportunity to slim the air transport system.  Gössling, author of a new study in Global Environmental Change, finds 1% of the global population caused half of carbon emissions linked to aviation in 2018. That's about half a billion tons of CO2, or at least 1% of annual global CO2 emissions, per CNN and the Guardian. Of rich countries, the US emitted more than the next 10 countries combined in 2018, though 53% of the population didn't fly at all. Globally, only 11% of people took a flight and just 4% flew abroad. But those frequent flyers traveled 35,000 miles a year on average, the equivalent of one short-haul flight per month, per the study. With no one covering the cost of the damage from emissions, estimated at $100 billion in 2018, this  represents a major subsidy to the most affluent,  researchers say. They suggest airlines meet environmental conditions in exchange for government bailouts. This has happened in France with Air France agreeing to limit domestic flights, per the BBC. Another possibility is a fee on frequent fliers, though Gössling thinks higher ticket prices are unlikely to deter the 1%. He suggests airlines  increase the share of [low carbon] synthetic fuels mix every year up to 100% by 2050.  A rep for the International Air Transport Association says airlines have  agreed to explore pathways to how we could move to net zero emissions by around 2060.

Since then, Yahoo has revealed itself to have been the victim of the two biggest data breaches ever, resulting in information from more than a billion users being stolen. According to the Washington Post, experts expected Verizon to demand Yahoo knock billions off the purchase price or to simply call off the deal entirely. But on Tuesday, the companies announced the deal was going through—at a comparatively minor 7% discount. Verizon will now purchase Yahoo for $4.48 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. What's left of Yahoo after the sale—an entity to be known as Altaba—will split liability with Verizon for any future lawsuits that result from the Yahoo data breaches. Altaba alone will be responsible for whatever happens with an ongoing SEC investigation into the hacks. Sources say Verizon went through with the deal at a minor discount for multiple reasons. One, Verizon has a ton of money and a few billion dollars weren't going to make a difference to it. Two, Verizon says the number of Yahoo users who left following the hacks was  minimal.  Verizon is basically buying Yahoo in order to advertise to users on its news and sports sites, Tumblr, and Flickr; if a bunch of Yahoo users fled the service, Verizon would have fewer people to advertise to.

The procurement took another three years, but Wendy's says it will finally have enough berries to decorate a seasonal salad coming to 6,500 North American restaurants. Will the pursuit pay off? Probably, suggests a study of 1,000. Above limiting sugar, salt, or fat, consumers say adding more produce is the most important dietary change they're making, reports the Wall Street Journal. That may partly explain the consumer shift from fast-food to fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle that prepare fresh food. Wendy's and others are hoping to compete. McDonald's is offering kale salads, Del Taco is promoting its use of fresh avocado, and Chick-fil-A is adding what it says is fresh, locally sourced produce, like red cabbage and carrots, to its chicken wrap.

It could happen with a sustained surge in consumer demand, but they're not seeing it yet, and time is running out. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 940,000 people signed up during February for private coverage under President Obama's health care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million. But with open enrollment ending March 31, that means to meet the goal, another 1.8 million people would have to sign up by the end of the month, an average of about 60,000 a day. That's way above the daily averages for January and February, which have ranged between 33,000 and 34,000, and the math seems to be going against the administration. The 943,000 enrolled in February fell short of the target of 1.27 million that HHS had initially set for the month. The goal of 6 million sign-ups is itself a lower bar than was originally set.

"(Dec 15, 2011  5:03 PM) A 90-year-old former member of the Nazi SS is heading to prison for murder—67 years later. An ambulance picked up the wheelchair-bound Heinrich Boere at his nursing home in Germany and carried him to a prison hospital, the BBC reports. A medical expert ruled him fit to serve his term for the killing of three Dutch people in 1944. He has admitted to the killings, saying he was following orders and would otherwise have faced a concentration camp. An appeal of his sentence was rejected.  At no time in 1944 did I act with the feeling that I was committing a crime,  he said in court; now, he says he feels differently. But the judge called the killings  totally random.  The half-German, half-Dutch Boere was initially convicted of the killings in 1949 in Amsterdam, but he wasn't extradited. Decades later, a German court rejected the conviction because Boere hadn't been at the trial. He was finally indicted in Germany in 2008 and sentenced last year.","Ex-Nazi, 90, Starts Life Sentence","Ex-Nazi, ____, Starts Life Sentence",90,Copy( 90 ),0
"(Apr 15, 2015  5:26 PM CDT) Parents outraged by Common Core can at least be glad their kids aren't being schooled in North Korea. The Telegraph reports that middle school and high school teachers there have been issued a manual to use while teaching a new subject for 2015:  Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities.  The manual contains details of Kim Jong Un's childhood—specifically, the amazing story of how he was driving by age 3, per YTN TV. It also notes that Kim is an awesome artist, pens musical scores, and was acing yachting races before puberty.  At the age of 9, Kim Jong Un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company who was visiting North Korea at the time,  one of the passages reportedly reads (he won that race  despite the odds,  per Metro). This inherent ability to win at life apparently runs in the family: The Telegraph brings up old claims that were made about Kim's father. Kim Jong Il supposedly walked at 3 weeks of age, talked at 8 weeks, wrote six operas, and penned 1,500 books during his three-year college tenure (take that, L. Ron Hubbard). But a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University thinks the new curriculum is less about genealogical bragging rights and more about panicked propaganda.  Not many people in the North have respect for Mr. Kim, so children are being taught how great and powerful he is,  Toshimitsu Shigemura tells the Telegraph.  The children believe it, of course, but the teachers have no choice but to believe it.

"(Jul 5, 2015  6:45 PM CDT) A teenager's punishment for sleeping with an underage girl has sparked yet another effort in the movement to reform sex-offender laws, the New York Times reports. Last December, 19-year-old Zachery Anderson of Elkhart, Indiana, met a girl on the dating app Hot or Not, met her in person on Dec. 19, and had sex with her at a Michigan playground. Worried about her whereabouts, the girl's mother called police—who eventually arrested Anderson because the girl was 14, not 17 like she'd told him. Anderson pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct, was sentenced in April to 90 days in jail, and has been placed on a sex-offender registry for 25 years, reports WNDU. He'll be out on Thursday and will have to keep away from public places and allow authorities to search his home every three months. And during his 5-year probation, Anderson can't own a computer, use a smartphone, or continue his computer-related degree, the South Bend Tribune reports. WNDU noted in May he had to abandon his major and would probably lose his scholarship. Anderson's parents, the girl, and her mother all appealed for leniency, and Michigan has a law (the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act) that actually allows first-time offenders between ages 17 and 21 to receive a lighter sentence. But instead the judge lectured Anderson about online hookups:  Meet, hook up, have sex, sayonara,  he said.  Totally inappropriate behavior.  The head of an advocacy group aiming to reform sex-offender laws says Anderson's case (she terms it a conviction  on steroids ) is common, and often ruins people's careers. But changing laws is difficult, Brenda V. Jones says, because lawmakers are nervous about being  soft on sex offenders.  Meanwhile, Anderson's family is trying to find him a new home to accommodate sex-offender laws while their lawyer tries to withdraw Anderson's guilty plea; an Aug. 5 hearing is planned.

Both men made six figures as NYC garbage collectors last year (Molina $112,000 as a driver, Sankaer $100,000 as a helper), complete with health insurance and a 401(k), CNNMoney reports. And although not all trash workers rack up those kind of bucks, most enjoy a higher salary than not only many high school dropouts (with median earnings in 2013 of about $24,000, per the Department of Ed), but many high school grads ($30,000) and even some college grads ($48,500 for those with a bachelor's degree). Per the Department of Labor, the median annual wage for  refuse and recyclable materials collectors  is $33,600, with those in the top 10% pulling in $58,590. And if you're in a high-paying state, those wages are even more: In New York, for example, the annual mean wage is $52,570, or just over $25 per hour. To be sure, Molina and Sanka earn that paycheck: They work 55 to 60 hours a week from 7pm to 3am, do lots of heavy lifting in unsafe environments and all sorts of weather, and deal with stuff no one else would want to (that human body part: a leg Sankar spotted in a dumpster). And some people feel there's still a stigma attached to handling trash. But it's a relatively easy field to get into: There's no high school diploma needed for many private companies, and firms will often train for the commercial license required to drive a truck. Plus industry wages have been consistently rising, qualified workers are in demand, and there's plenty of job security.

An academic may shed light on the question with his analysis of 1,000 eye-witness descriptions of the alleged creature, the BBC reports. Marine biologist Adrien Shine notes wryly that several spotters were proprietors in the area. In fact the first modern witness was a hotel manager who  yelled at her husband, 'Stop! The beast!'  says Shine. Although there is a legend of a  water beast  in the area dating back to the Middle Ages, that 1933 sighting started a wave of eye-witness accounts from all walks of life. Still, Shine considers the first witness sincere because she hid from the limelight and let her husband report the incident. In fact Shine defends most sightings, even though one 1934 Nessie photo turned out to be a toy submarine with a serpent's head attached. Shine also objects to the notion that Nessie witnesses should  take more water with it,  meaning they were inebriated at the time.  I have become more skeptical over the years,  he admits.

The ruling Law and Justice party launched a new investigation into the crash after accusing Russia of withholding evidence, including the plane's black boxes, which Russia says it needs to complete its still-open investigation. Prosecutor Maciej Kujawski tells the AP that the autopsy reports Russia have provided don't explain the crash, which has been chalked up to pilot error but which some in the party suspect may have been an intentional explosion that served as an assassination. The post-mortems will use  computer tomography in the field of toxicology and DNA ...

"(Jan 19, 2016  10:00 AM) You thought Asian camel crickets were bad. A new report in journal Peer J finds hundreds of bugs likely lurk in your home, including spiders, beetles, ants, and book lice. Scientists got down on their hands and knees and combed 50 houses in the suburbs of Raleigh, NC, picking up any bugs they found, to determine the diversity of arthropods indoors. They  found far more diversity than most people would expect,  study leader Matt Bertone tells National Geographic. More specifically, they gathered 10,000 bugs from 579 species. If that doesn't freak you out, this probably will: Each home housed 100 species on average, per New Scientist, though one revealed 211 species. And less than 1% of rooms were bug-free.  That old wives' tale that you're never more than 10 feet away from a spider? If you're in your home, that might be true,  Bertone says. Every home contained ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders, and gall midges, which  rely on things we produce or have in our homes,  says Bertone. About 98% held book lice, which eat mold and mildew, reports Wired. There were even some bugs scientists suspect might be new species. Since scientists searched carpets, floorboards, and shelves, but not behind walls, under heavy furniture, or in cabinets, they say more bugs are probably hiding nearby. On the plus side, most were harmless.  The residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much,  says Bertone. But except for the occasional cockroaches, termites, and fleas, the bugs are  not dangerous and you won't see them unless you really look for them.

The biggest destination was California, which accounted for about one-third of the busing.

In the 15th century, there were around 300,000 Jews in Spain, but in 1492 they were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Many of those who left went to North Africa or the Ottoman Empire; indeed, even today 90% of the 100,000 Jews in Turkey are descendents of Sephardic Jews. However, the conversos, those who converted to Christianity and stayed in Spain, were targeted heavily by the Inquisition.

In the first month alone, there were 6,000 inquiries about regaining citizenship. However, the details of the new policy are still being worked out, and some have complained that the policy of return only applies to still practicing Jews, not to secular Jews or Christian converts.

To begin with, Steve Ballmer's $2 billion purchase of the team is now all but a done deal and expected to close next month, the LA Times reports. But that momentum didn't stop Sterling from suing the NBA for $1 billion in damages, alleging that the league illegally wrenched the team from him, reports the Wall Street Journal. Not so, says the league, because wife Shelly had every right to strike a deal with Ballmer on her own once her husband was deemed mentally unfit. The kicker there is that Shelly Sterling, as part of her to deal to sell the team, indemnified the league against any lawsuits from her husband. Which is to say, she would have to pay that $1 billion in damages herself if by some long shot he wins in court, reports AP. The league, for its part, is brushing of the lawsuit as  entirely baseless.  And the final footnote belongs to the Upshot blog of the New York Times, which crunches the numbers to reveal that Donald Sterling would make a return on his investment of 15,900% under the Ballmer deal. Sterling bought the club for $12.5 million in 1981.",Sterling Sues NBA for $1B,Sterling Sues NBA for $____B,1,Copy( 1 ),0

A de Havilland DHC-3 Otter air taxi crashed just after 11am at the airport in Soldotna, around 75 miles southwest of Anchorage, the AP reports. The aircraft was operated by Rediske Air, an air charter company whose owner, Walter Rediske, was the pilot killed in the crash. When fire crews reached the airport,  the aircraft was crashed off the side of the runway and it was fully involved in flames  which took around 10 minutes to extinguish, an emergency services spokeswoman tells the Anchorage Daily News.

The video, which also features a significant amount of footage from GoT season seven, includes a shot of (spoiler alert) Jon Snow and Sansa Stark apparently embracing in Winterfell. Because they were last seen together at Castle Black, this indicates the scene takes place during a future season of the show, Entertainment Weekly reports. At io9, Beth Elderkin jokingly runs through a number of theories one might be able to parse from the footage, and people were pretty excited on Twitter.

What the San Francisco Chronicle describes as a possible  dream job  has opened up, and you could start as soon as April. The gig: taking over the East Brother Light Station, a late-1800s lighthouse-turned-B&B on a small island on the northern edge of San Francisco Bay. The two current caretakers, Che Rodgers and Jillian Meeker, are leaving their posts and need two others to take over—but those two others will need to be willing and able to perform a plethora of upkeep tasks to earn what's estimated to be a $130,000 salary, including cooking, cleaning, laundry, setting up supply runs, and ferrying patrons to and from the mainland, per the Guardian. (The salary would be split between the two people. Which leads to some of the requirements for the job: Applicants must have a Coast Guard license to operate the station's boat (and the application indicates that if you have to ask about getting a license, you're likely not going to be qualified in time), and they also can't smoke. The job is also  incompatible with children,  and animals are  strongly discouraged, especially dogs.  The caretakers will need to run the inn Thursday through Sunday and can expect to get between two to four weeks of vacation annually.

The payout needs approval from the city's spending panel and that OK is expected to come tomorrow. Once granted, the money would be doled out over a two-year period. A statement from Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's office says that the settlement  should not be interpreted as a judgment on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial.  Rather, the city's decision to accept civil liability in the case was done to avoid the cost of a court battle that could have ultimately cost taxpayers much more. The Sun reports on the magnitude of the settlement: Since 2011, the city has only paid out sums in excess of $200,000 six times; there were a total of 120 claims made in that period related to alleged police brutality, and the Grays' settlement is just slightly larger than all of those combined.",Freddie Gray's Family to Get $6.4M From Baltimore,Freddie Gray's Family to Get $____M From Baltimore,6.4,Copy( 6.4 ),0

If Ibrahim al-Asiri—who was believed to have been involved in an unsuccessful 2009 plot to blow up an aircraft over Detroit on Christmas Day with an underwear bomb—is dead, it would  represent a serious blow to operational capability  for al-Qaeda, the UN says. The report does not detail how al-Asiri may have died. Government officials in the US are now looking into evidence that the Saudi-born terrorist is, in fact, dead, CNN reports. But some analysts say that reports of al-Asiri's death should be received with skepticism because al-Qaeda has yet to acknowledge it. One former British spy tells CNN that  it would be extremely out of the ordinary  for al-Qaeda not to release a eulogy for such a senior leader. In addition to the Christmas Day plot that failed due to a malfunction, al-Asiri, born in 1982, is believed to have built a bomb used in a 2009 attempt to assassinate a Saudi official (the bomber, al-Asiri's brother, was killed in the attempt), according to a 2014 BBC profile. In 2010, al-Asiri built bombs disguised as printer cartridges that were intended to be shipped to Chicago, the Washington Post reported in 2012. This plot was foiled thanks to a tip from Saudi intelligence.

Kayak guide Jessica O'Connor and chef Dion Reynolds, both 23, were discovered in a tiny clearing in Kahurangi National Park at the north end of the South Island after a search helicopter spotted smoke from their fire on Wednesday. The couple had set off May 9 intending to spend about a week in the country's second-largest national park, an area of about 1,745 square miles, per the BBC. But they suffered injuries in a fall as they became lost in fog. They stayed put for a few days before going in search of water, per the New Zealand Herald. When they finally found it, they set up camp and lit a fire. Searchers had been scouring the area for a week and a half when the smoke was observed before 1pm local time Wednesday.

But NJ.com reports Phyliss died in 2013, and the bank is now preparing to foreclose on the property. Instead of letting everything in his DIY bunker go to waste, the 74-year-old made a more charitable decision: donate it to hurricane victims in Puerto Rico. It was Victoria Martinez-Barber, the food vendor for his estate sale, who sparked the idea, after she mentioned to Badame that all of the proceeds from her food truck were being sent to her now-homeless family in Arecibo. Badame at first offered $100 to help her out, but then he revealed his food storage area—and an idea was born.  I saw everything that my family would need,  an emotional Martinez-Barber says. Badame realized the food was just going to get  trashed,  so he gave permission for Martinez-Barber and her husband to take his stockpile.

Police Commissioner William Bratton has floated one approach that's already getting some support: amnesty.  Warrants never go away. There's no expiration date,  says Bratton, who envisions a program in which people with outstanding warrants would be notified that their risk of arrest could disappear if they come forward.  It would be great to get rid of that backlog. It's not to our benefit from a policing standpoint to have all those warrants floating around out there.  Mayor Bill de Blasio's criminal justice coordinator says officials are investigating  how to safely reduce the number of already outstanding warrants.  Officials are redesigning the summons form itself, texting reminders to people ahead of their court dates, as well as cutting down court processing times to shrink the number of people who end up in jail for low-level offenses. They'll post summons data broken down by race for analysis, a concession to advocates who claim tickets disproportionately target minorities. One expert says many of the nearly 40% who failed to show for court last year are people who are homeless or mentally ill and don't have money to pay fines.

Gregg Phillips, whose unsubstantiated claim that the election was marred by 3 million illegal votes was tweeted by the president, was listed on the rolls in Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi, according to voting records and election officials in those states. He voted only in Alabama in November, records show. In a post earlier this month, Phillips described  an amazing effort  by volunteers tied to True the Vote, an organization whose board he sits on, who he said found  thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people.  The AP found that Phillips was registered in Alabama and Texas under the name Gregg Allen Phillips, with the identical Social Security number. Mississippi records list him under the name Gregg A. Phillips. He has lived in all three states. At the time of November's presidential election, Phillips' status was  inactive  in Mississippi and suspended in Texas. Officials in both states, however, say that Phillips could have voted by producing identification and updating his address at the polls. Reached by telephone Monday, Phillips said he was unaware of his multiple registrations but asked,  Why would I know or care?  He added:  Doesn't that just demonstrate how broken the system is?

The Texas House has passed a bill that would raise the speed limit for certain stretches of highway from 80mph to 85mph, Fox News reports. If the bill passes the Senate and becomes law, it’ll once again give Texas the highest speed limit in the country—a designation it held until Utah tied its 80mph speed limit in 2009. Of course, not everyone’s on-board with the change.  The two things that contribute most to traffic accidents are speed and alcohol,  said the president of the Southwest Insurance Information Institute.

On February 12, Icahn began selling his shares in crane and lifting equipment supplier Manitowoc Company for $32 to $34. A few days later the Commerce Department recommended steep tariffs and import quotas on steel. Then Trump threatened a trade war Thursday and Manitowoc tumbled 5.48% to $26.37, meaning Icahn's shares lost about $6 million. He quietly submitted his SEC filing about a week later. Icahn hadn't bought or sold any Manitowoc shares in the previous three years, reports ThinkProgress, which broke the story.

But in order to understand the crime, you need to know the victim: the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The Times describes it as a  cartel  that controls the bulk of the world's maple syrup supply;  it's like OPEC,  says its acting head. To keep prices high, it stockpiles syrup produced in excess of the strict quota it sets for its members; in a bad year, it'll dip into the reserve (which now stands at 46 million pounds) to keep the supply consistent. The problem arose in 2011, after a bumper year forced the federation to rent out an additional warehouse, where it stored 16,000 drums of 54 gallons each. The thieves rented out space in the same warehouse, allowing them to access the facility without raising suspicions. Then they slowly began emptying the syrup barrels, in some cases refilling the drums with water. Their final take: 6 million pounds. And unlike the predicament faced by many criminals, the Times explains they were able to unload it at full price, by presenting themselves as legitimate syrup dealers in neighboring New Brunswick and selling it throughout the region and to the US.

The county is using eminent domain to take over at least 16 Turnberry Lane homes, and likely 15 more, and bulldoze them in order to make room for a new four-lane road that will increase access to SunTrust Park, currently under construction. As 11Alive reports, the county has ensured homeowners they will be given fair market value for their homes—but they likely won't be given the amount they could have received for their home had it stayed put and, ultimately, been within walking distance of the new ballpark. Deadspin has more on the contentious background of the new ballpark, including the public paying for it but having no say in the negotiations and the politician behind it getting voted out of office.

Per the AP, South Korea's military says that on Saturday, the North fired from its east coast what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The projectiles flew about 250 miles, with an apogee of 30 miles, per South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seoul's Blue House says the new tests were likely meant to be another sign of Kim Jong Un's displeasure with joint military drills that the US and South Korea are holding, as well as a test of how reliable the weapons are. The New York Times notes this latest launch comes just a day after President Trump told reporters at the White House he'd received a  beautiful  three-page letter from Kim on Thursday that was  very positive.  On Twitter Saturday morning, Trump expanded on the letter reportedly sent by Kim.  He stated, very nicely, that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over,  Trump posted.

If they’re caught it  almost always destroys their chances of pulling themselves out of a hole,  says one assistant Florida state attorney, as costs of tickets, court dates, and more pile up.  Some of it is a trap,  says one judge,  and some of it is the defendant’s fault.  One prosecutor has some simple advice for suspended drivers: Stop driving.

"(Feb 29, 2020  9:00 AM) The United States signed a peace agreement with Taliban militants on Saturday aimed at bringing an end to 18 years of bloodshed in Afghanistan and allowing US troops to return home from America's longest war. Under the agreement, the US would draw its forces down to 8,600 from 13,000 in the next three to four months, with the remaining US forces withdrawing in 14 months. The complete pullout, however, would depend on the Taliban meeting their commitments to prevent terrorism, per the AP.

Nazis made off with an estimated 80,000 bells, most of which were melted down for their metal and used to make weapons and ammunition during World War II, reports the BBC. By the end of war, about 1,300 bells remained intact. But they weren't returned to the churches. Instead, they landed in a  bell cemetery  in Hamburg, at least initially, per the BBC.

From a mention in a book, he learned the bell, dated to 1555, had been sitting in plain sight in the courtyard of a Catholic Church in Munster, Germany, alongside two other bells. The German diocese claims the bells were loaned out to parishes across former West Germany after World War II as the British military blocked the return of the bells to eastern territories. Now the property of the German government, the bell of St Catherine's church will be returned on a permanent loan once the coronavirus pandemic settles down.

But how Northup died remains a mystery that historians are still trying to solve, the AP reports. To recap, Northup was living with his family in upstate New York when two white men lured him to Washington, DC, in 1841, kidnapped him, and sold him into slavery in New Orleans. He survived 12 years on a Louisiana cotton plantation before friends sprung him, and he went on to publish a memoir and help escaped slaves attain freedom via the Underground Railroad. But around 1863, he vanished. Was he killed as a Union Army spy? Did he hit the bottle and get kidnapped again? Or did he just die someplace where a black man wouldn't get a proper burial during the Civil War? Historians have heard or surmised such versions of Northup's death, and one author, David Fiske, checked cemeteries and death records but came up empty.  He may have just wandered around from place to place and died somewhere nobody knew who he was, and he was buried in a potter's field,  said Fiske. But Northup's descendents tell USA Today that they're more focused on his accomplishments:  Every challenge and obstacle that I do have, is somewhat nothing compared to his, so there is no reason that I can't accomplish or get past it,  says Northup's great-great-great-great-grandson.",12 Years a Slave  Writer: Killed as Union Spy?,____ Years a Slave  Writer: Killed as Union Spy?,12,Copy( 12 ),0

But Mitoshi Matsumoto says the company is trying to change that description to Japan's best-known former 7-Eleven franchisee. The convenience store owner and the company have been engaged in a battle over its round-the-clock demands: Last month, Matsumoto said he would close the store—open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, per company policy—for New Year's Day only, so that he and his two full-time workers could break from their normal schedule of 14-hour shifts. He'd already irked the company in February by deciding to trim his store hours and close between 1am and 6am daily. 7-Eleven threatened to close the store then but backed off after he attracted media attention. Matsumoto says retaliation took the form of a letter sent to him 10 days ago that said 7-Eleven had logged 78 complaints in 2019 about his store, and that the location would be closed if he didn't rectify the situation by year-end. The Japan Times reports negotiations failed on Sunday and 7-Eleven canceled his contract, but that Matsumoto still plans to close Wednesday and reopen Thursday—though his cash register won't work and he won't be able to restock inventory. He says he may sue to remain open. The Times notes 7-Eleven is controlled by a Japanese company and that 40% of the convenience stores in the country are 7-Eleven.

"(Feb 5, 2016  9:40 AM) Pope Francis and the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church will meet in Cuba next week in a historic step to heal the 1,000-year-old schism that divided Christianity between East and West, both churches announced Friday. The Feb. 12 meeting between Francis and Patriarch Kirill will be the first ever between the leaders of the Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, which is the largest in Orthodoxy. Francis is due to travel to Mexico Feb. 12-18. He will stop in Cuba on the way and meet with Kirill at the Havana airport, where they will speak privately for about two hours and then sign a joint declaration, the Vatican said.  This event has extraordinary importance in the path of ecumenical relations and dialogue among Christian confessions,  said the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. The two churches split during the Great Schism of 1054 and have remained estranged over a host of issues, including the primacy of the pope and Russian Orthodox accusations that the Catholic Church is poaching converts in former Soviet lands. Those tensions have prevented previous popes from ever meeting with the Russian patriarch, even though the Vatican has long insisted that it was merely ministering to tiny Catholic communities in largely Orthodox lands. The persecution of Christians—Catholic and Orthodox—in the Middle East and Africa, however, has had the effect of bringing the two churches closer together. Both the Vatican and the Orthodox Church have been outspoken in denouncing attacks on Christians and the destruction of Christian monuments, particularly in Syria.",Pope Plans to End 1K-Year-Old Russian Rift,Pope Plans to End ____K-Year-Old Russian Rift,1,"Paraphrase( 1,000 , K )",1

The Nevada Department of Wildlife is on the hunt for  Bubba,  a gigantic, nearly legendary black bear who has broken into at least 50 homes and caused $70,000 in property damage, the Wall Street Journal reports. His MO is consistent: He always breaks in by punching through the garage door, and tends to leave basketball-sized dumps inside as a calling card. Forced down from the mountains by harsh recent winters, Bubba is twice the size of a normal black bear, and he’s proven exceedingly elusive. One homeowner claims to have shot him, only to see the bullet bounce off his enormous skull, injuring, but not killing him. The Wildlife Department has begun a concerted hunt, with one official patrolling nightly, armed with a fire extinguisher, pepper spray, and two dogs that can only be commanded in Russian. But some want the bear spared. After Bubba broke into a local church, the reverend pleaded for him to be relocated, not killed.

"(Apr 4, 2016  12:37 AM CDT) Edwin Shifrin, 93, seldom discussed his time at war and his memory is fading, but the Missouri man received a prisoner-of-war medal in February after son Dan Shifrin dug through old news reports and his father's military records and pieced together what happened. Assigned to the Army's 30th Infantry Division, 1st Battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment, Company C, Shifrin landed on France's Normandy beach in June 1944, a week after the D-Day invasion, and then fought the Germans in battles at St. Lo and Mortain. The Germans captured Shifrin on Aug. 7 and he ended up in the Stalag III-C prison camp, about 90 miles east of Berlin. Telegrams to US family members notified them he was missing in action. Shifrin was on the camp's  escape committee,  which devised a plan for prisoners to hide during roll call, causing a futile search for escapees. That allowed the prisoners to slip away unnoticed days later, when the head count had been lowered. Shifrin made his getaway with other prisoners in mid-January 1945, just weeks before the Russians liberated the camp. Dan Shifrin tells the AP that  the rest of their journey is pretty hazy,  but what's known is they hitchhiked on Allied supply trucks and purloined rides on horses and bikes on their way to Italy. By that April, Shifrin was back on US soil. After getting his law degree, he became a St. Louis attorney and worked well into his 80s.  We knew he'd been in the war, that he had been captured, and that he escaped. That's about it. He didn't talk about it,  his son says.

The cause was congestive heart failure, notes ABC News. In addition to her famous campaign against drugs, the one-time actress promoted several causes while she was in the White House and even in the years after. She was a passionate advocate for lifting restrictions on stem cell research and promoting better treatment of America's veterans. But above all, Nancy Reagan was a fiercely devoted wife.  My life began with Ronnie,  she told Vanity Fair magazine in 1998. The first lady's public life had its share of controversy but also earned the respect of the nation, making Nancy Reagan one of America's most admired women in the 1980s and beyond. Anne Frances  Nancy  Robbins was born on July 6, 1921 in New York City to Kenneth Robbins, a car salesman, and Edith Luckett Robbins, an actress. She met Ronald Reagan in 1950, when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild and she was seeking help with a problem: Her name had been wrongly included on a published list of suspected communist sympathizers. They discussed it over dinner, and she later wrote that she realized on that first blind date  he was everything that I wanted.  They wed two years later, on March 4, 1952. She was thrust into the political life when her husband ran for California governor in 1966 and won. She found it a surprisingly rough business.  The movies were custard compared to politics,  she said. The couple had two children together, Patricia Ann and Ronald Prescott.

"(Aug 26, 2011  4:23 PM CDT) He may be an anti-tax champion now, but Rick Perry has supported billions of dollars in tax hikes throughout his political career—among them the biggest increase that ever occurred in Texas history, the Texas Tribune reports. Just weeks ago, the governor signed an online sales tax provision aimed at raising $60 million over five years. Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform slapped the move with a  new tax  label. And Perry voted for more than 12 tax increases during his six-year stint in the Texas House. While Perry was a representative, sales tax increased from 4.125% to 6.25%; he voted for several increases alongside Democrats, including the largest in state history in 1987, which raised $5 billion. He also supported tax hikes on corporations, motorists, and liquor. As governor, he established a panel for tax reform that cut property taxes but raised cigarette taxes and subjected many more businesses to a franchise tax. Will all this hurt him in 2012?

Authorities say Morabito's use of his real name triggered a six-month investigation that ended with his arrest at a hotel in Uruguay, the Guardian reports. Morabito had apparently been living in the Punta del Este resort area since slipping into the country in 2002 using a fake Brazilian passport with the name Francisco Capeletto. Authorities say Morabito will be held in Uruguay for at least three months for offenses including using false papers. After that, he is expected to be extradited to Italy, where he has a 30-year prison sentence to serve. His wife, an Angolan national, was also arrested. Morabito was a member of the 'Ndrangheta crime gang, which controls much of the world's cocaine trade, reports the BBC.

A lengthy December 2020 Los Angeles Times article about the player has a less positive flavor. The Californian, now 24, played for Stanford as a freshman and alleges that two blows to the head she suffered there weren't properly treated—and ended up ending her career and ruining her health. As Patrick Hruby reports, Stanford was just one part of Hodson's plan, which involved playing in the 2020 Olympic Games and then having a pro career abroad. Then came that first hit, on Nov. 9, 2015. Team coach John Dunning ran Hodson and her teammate through the  courage  drill, in which a coach on a stool spikes the ball toward the players, who need to  dig,  meaning dive to keep it from hitting the floor. Hruby cites a 2012 YouTube video that shows Dunning running the drill.  You need to be careful,  he says at the start.  If I were you and going to do this—well, I don’t know if I would do it at all.  Hodson did do it, and suffered a blow to her right head strong enough that it impacted her vision. A team doctor diagnosed her the next day with a  mild concussion,  and vision issues and brain fog persisted. On Nov. 27, she took a ball to the forehead while playing UCLA. Hruby cites studies and the CDC in reporting it's been shown athletes who experience a second concussion while not healed from the prior one have an increased risk of  prolonged or permanent symptoms.  That's been the case for Hodson, who says that UCLA game was the last time she played well; insomnia, migraines, dizziness, and blurry vision followed. By early 2017, a clinical neuropsychologist determined parts of her brain were operating at 10%. She medically retired.

The 38-year-old told a court in Norway that he and his colleagues  lost control  after going out drinking in the afternoon and were still boozing at 2am, four hours before departure time, although they did switch from whiskey to beer at some point. The crew was breathalyzed after an anonymous tip before their Aug. 8 flight from Oslo to the Greek island of Crete, and authorities found that the pilot, co-pilot, and two out of three flight attendants were over the legal limit. The co-pilot was sentenced to six months in prison yesterday, while one flight attendant got 45 days and the other 60 days. The 50-year-old pilot—who faces more serious charges because he was responsible for the crew, as well as around 100 passengers—has had his trial postponed until next month and will remain in custody until then, reports NewsinEnglish.no. He was found to have a blood alcohol level around twice the legal limit, the BBC notes. In a statement, the Latvian airline said all four crew members have been suspended prior to dismissal, and it has brought in mandatory breath tests for all  safety-critical personnel.

The spree reportedly began when Syed shot and killed a woman in her 20s inside her home, though police haven't said yet whether there was any relationship between the pair. (A neighbor said a man and three children were later escorted from the house.) Syed then killed two commuters in separate carjackings before killing himself as police closed in on him at an intersection, reports the Los Angeles Times. Two other people were wounded, and drivers on local freeways reported being shot at during the spree. One of the carjacking deaths is especially chilling. Police say Syed apparently ran out of gas in the first car he stole, then commandeered a BMW stopped at a red light. He forced the driver out of the car, made him walk to the curb, and shot him.

George Romero, the director known as the  Father of the Zombie Film  for 1968's Night of the Living Dead and its follow-ups, died of lung cancer on Sunday, CNN reports. He was 77. Romero, who grew up in the Bronx, used money from directing commercials to make Night of the Living Dead, which, per the BBC, was the  first film to depict cannibalistic reanimated corpses.  It made $30 million on a budget of $114,000 and spawned five sequels, including 1978's mall-set Dawn of the Dead, which is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies of all time. Romero also directed non-zombie horror movies, including 1982's Creepshow. Romero spent most of his life in Pittsburgh, which now hosts an annual Zombie Fest and is sometimes called the  Zombie Capital of the World,  the Hollywood Reporter notes. The director, who mixed social commentary with the gore, most recently returned to the zombie genre with the Empire of the Dead graphic novel.  I used to be the only guy in the playground, I was the only guy doing zombies,  he said in a recent Timeline documentary.  Then all of a sudden The Walking Dead happened and it became mainstream.

"(Jul 7, 2016  1:57 PM CDT) A joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Times presents a troubling look at how  unknown tens of thousands  of Americans have their lives ruined by false drug arrests. The problem stems from a $2 drug-test kit used by police departments around the country. They've been around for more than 40 years and haven't changed much in their simplicity: A police officer drops a suspected sample of a drug into a vial of liquid, and if the liquid turns the wrong color, the arrest is made. The story details the many ways the field tests can go wrong, so much so that they're generally inadmissible in court. The problem, though, is that the vast majority of such arrests never end up at trial—those arrested typically plea to lesser charges to avoid the possibility of a lengthy sentence. The story uses the example of 43-year-old Amy Albritton, who took a plea deal and three weeks in jail after a field test suggested she had cocaine in her car, no matter how much she insisted to the contrary. She lost her job and her apartment, and her new felony record kept her from getting any kind of meaningful new work. Turns out, the test was a false positive, which she learned only when informed by the journalists working on this story.  Every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence,  write Ryan Gabrielson and Topher Sanders.  At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions.  It's unclear what the standard error rate is on the kits, but follow-up testing at individual departments suggest that it's far from  modest.

Predictably, respondents weren’t in the mood to forgive BP, either; almost 60% said the company should be forced to pay financial losses even if it drives it out of business.

A Philadelphia dealer in historic documents has purchased a reel-to-reel recording from Air Force One following the death of John F. Kennedy, and it’s got 30 minutes of never-before-heard conversations from the trip between Dallas and Washington, the AP reports. Top Kennedy aide Gen. Chester Clifton collected material from the JFK administration, and Philadelphia’s Raab Collection bought his archive after his widow died and is now putting the recording up for sale.

She'd been on her way home from the mall after buying clothes for her approaching high school graduation. He'd already had two DUIs—his first when he was 17—and was driving on a suspended license when he killed Caitlin, reports the Chicago Tribune. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit and he had marijuana in his system.

His game at a high level at the end of an unusually easy path through a Grand Slam field, Nadal overwhelmed first-time major finalist Anderson 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win his third championship at Flushing Meadows, the AP reports. It is the No. 1-ranked Nadal's second Grand Slam title of the year and 16th overall. Among men, only Roger Federer has more, with 19.

At No. 32, Anderson was the lowest-ranked US Open men's finalist since the ATP computer rankings began in 1973.

"(Feb 7, 2020  11:22 AM) The impeachment of President Trump revolved around a midsummer phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the holdup of almost $400 million in US military aide to the country in its war with Russia. But according to three Ukrainian officials and an ex-US senior official who talked to BuzzFeed, at least a half-dozen more commercial sales of arms and ammunition worth about $30 million combined haven't yet received approval from the Trump administration—and now Ukraine wants its tens of millions of dollars in down payments back. BuzzFeed's sources note five of the deals have been held up by the US for about a year, while the sixth has been delayed for more than a year, even though such deals typically take about two months to approve, per one of the Ukrainian officials and US State Department guidelines. BuzzFeed notes one of the deals, a $10 million ammunition sale, was first reported by Yahoo News in September, but the other five deals are newly reported. The export license for that ammunition sale, which is said to be the  most critical  for the Ukrainians, was submitted to the State Department in November 2018; down payments for the other five sales were made between January and March of last year. While the three Ukrainian officials aren't sure if the suspension of these six deals are linked to Trump's push to have the Bidens investigated, they do note these deals were delayed before Trump's July call with Zelensky, meaning there may be other reasons at play. In a statement to the Hill, the State Department noted it can't comment  on the status of specific defense trade direct commercial licensing cases  due to import and export regulations.",Report: Ukraine Wants Money Back From US on 6 More Deals,Report: Ukraine Wants Money Back From US on ____ More Deals,6,Trans( sixth ),1

"(Sep 21, 2019  12:40 PM CDT) Boeing isn't the only one to blame. So concludes an impressively detailed New York Times article about two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes since last year—which, it turns out, were caused at least partly by pilot error.  Look, we know as a fact that half of airline pilots graduated in the bottom of their class,  says a former Airbus pilot. Standards are apparently lower in Indonesia, the home country of Lion Air, whose plane went down on October 29 and killed all 189 passengers on board. Deregulated and plagued by accidents, the country's corrupt airline industry has been hiring inexperienced and underpaid pilots for years. When confronted by Boeing technology that pushed down the plane's nose—in theory to help it handle better—the flight crew was baffled. True, Boeing hadn't told pilots about the flawed MCAS system or described it in flight manuals. But the company figured pilots would react wisely when a plane's nose-up-or-down balance, or  trim,  got out of whack, by turning off electrics and reverting to manual trim. But the Lion Air crew failed to do so, and pilots on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302—which went down on March 10, killing 157—lost control amid other blunders. Both planes also suffered from all-too-common mechanical errors. But the lack of rigorous pilot training plays a key role.  In an emergency, it becomes a problem,  an industry expert told Business Insider in March.  If you have a complicated airplane and you basically put a student pilot in there, that's not a good thing.  Read the full article here.

That's because Maezawa is curious on how the overall concept of universal basic income—an idea often floated by US presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which a nation's citizens receive a regular, guaranteed payment—would affect people's overall well-being and happiness. An economist tells Reuters that what Maezawa is doing is somewhat different than the basic income idea: It's just a one-time payment to each recipient, and in Japan at the moment, people are still finding jobs in general due to a tight labor market. Still, Maezawa wants to see how his  winners  react.  What happens if someone who can't help themselves with their own power is given money ... to rebuild their lives?  he tweeted.

Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Feb. 5 for severe pneumonia and was later put on life support. The Prime Minister's Office says in a statement on its website that Lee  passed away peacefully  at 3:18am. Lee was feared for his authoritarian tactics but insisted that strict limits on speech and public protest were necessary to maintain stability in the multiethnic and multi-religious country. He guided Singapore for 31 years until 1990, making it into a global trade and finance center. Lee's legacy includes an efficient government with little corruption, low tax rates to attract foreign investment, excellent schools, and safe streets. He has faced criticism, though, for using tough tactics to consolidate power. Lee jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians. Lee commanded immense respect among Singaporeans, who this year will celebrate the country's 50th independence anniversary.

"(Aug 14, 2019  4:50 AM CDT) New Zealand officials admitted Wednesday that they made a mistake by allowing the man accused of killing 51 people at two Christchurch mosques to send a hand-written letter from his prison cell. The six-page letter from Brenton Tarrant was posted this week on the website 4chan, which has become notorious as a place for white supremacists to post their views. And it comes at a sensitive time, with other alleged killers from El Paso to Norway citing Tarrant as an inspiration. The letter appears to be written in pencil on a small notepad and is addressed to  Alan  in Russia. Much of it appears to be relatively innocuous, discussing a one-month trip Tarrant says he took to Russia in 2015. But the letter also warns that a  great conflict  is coming and uses language that could be construed as a call to arms, the AP reports. Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis said he didn't believe the prison system should have allowed Tarrant to send the letter.  I have made myself clear that this cannot happen again,  Davis said. But Davis also said that all New Zealand prisoners have rights that include the ability to send and receive mail, though the system has the ability to withhold correspondence and withheld some other letters Tarrant had attempted to send or receive.  We have never had to manage a prisoner like this before—and I have asked questions around whether our laws are now fit for purpose and asked for advice on what changes we may now need to make,  Davis said. In the letter, dated July 4, Tarrant cites Plato and other philosophers and writers as inspiration for his views, and says he  cannot go into any great detail about regrets or feelings as the guards will confiscate my letter if I do  and use it as evidence.",Letter From Alleged Mosque Gunman Appears on 4Chan,Letter From Alleged Mosque Gunman Appears on ____Chan,4,Copy( 4 ),0
"(Sep 24, 2017  11:06 AM CDT) A man's day out with his family resulted in the discovery of a 400-year-old painting of  perhaps one of the most famous gay men in history  by one of the most important painters in history, the Guardian reports. The story is only slightly less surprising because that man was Dr. Bendor Grosvenor of the BBC program Britain's Lost Masterpieces. Grosvenor noticed the painting of George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, during a visit to the historic Pollok House in Glasgow, according to the BBC.  There was this painting further up by the fireplace and it sounds rather silly to say it, but it was a bit of a eureka moment and I thought: ‘My god, that looks like a Rubens,'  the Guardian quotes Grosvenor as saying. The portrait was painted by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens around 1625 but was believed to have been lost. In reality, later artists painting over the background of the portrait—not to mention hundreds of years of dirt and grime—had obscured the work's identity as an original Rubens. It was confirmed as such through X-rays, cleaning, and scientific analysis of the wood it was painted on. The portrait is believed to have been bought by an art collector who owned the Pollok House in the late-1800s, the Telegraph reports. The man who authenticated it calls it a  rare addition to Ruben's portrait oeuvre.  Villiers was a minor noble elevated to duke by James I. Experts believe he was the king's lover, and a secret passageway connected the two men's bedrooms in one of James' residences. The restored portrait will be going on display in a Glasgow museum and art gallery this week.

Opal Lee, 90, set out from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, in September with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in Washington, DC, where she wants to present her petition to President Obama calling for a federal holiday on June 19. That's the day— Juneteenth —that Union soldiers came to Texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around Lee's church last August mushroomed into something bigger.  The people walked with me, and we've been going ever since,  Lee tells NPR.  I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice.  She was right. Invitations started coming, and Lee was happy to take them—in states ranging from Colorado and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition.  I walk wherever I’m invited,  Lee told CBS Pittsburgh during a stop in November.  Two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free.  Lee, who collects donations on GoFundMe, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to Obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count Juneteenth as a holiday, Lee says federal recognition is important.  It would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these United States, so it needs to be observed and celebrated,  she tells Fox4.  Slaves didn't free themselves,  she adds, per NPR.  There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished.  And if her pitch falls short next week?

"(Feb 4, 2015  9:13 AM) A new study finds that, despite your intentions, you may simply be inclined to cheat or not to cheat. As Phys.org reports, humans appear to be the rare mammals that can be either monogamous or polygamous—other species are typically one or the other. And now, University of Oxford researchers say they've found that some humans (53% of women and 43% of men) are more inclined to be faithful, while others (57% of men and 47% of women) are more inclined to be promiscuous.  This research suggests that there may be two distinct types of individuals within each sex, pursuing different mating strategies,  the researchers say of their results, published in Biology Letters. To get these results, the team compared the results from a questionnaire of sexual habits to data on something called the  2D:4D  ratio. That ratio has to do with finger length: The longer your ring finger is when compared to your index finger, the higher the levels of testosterone you were likely exposed to in the womb; these higher levels have been linked to a higher chance of promiscuity.  While not predictive of individual behavior, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous,  a University of Oxford press release explains. The researchers compared those results to the questionnaire data because, one explains,  human behavior is influenced by many factors, such as the environment and life experience, and what happens in the womb might only have a modest effect on something as complex as sexual relationships.  (Meanwhile, jealous men and women focus on very different things.)",57% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,____% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,57,Copy( 57 ),0

Kim Ki-jong was convicted of attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy, and obstruction, according to a Seoul Central District Court spokesman. Both Kim and the prosecution have one week to determine whether to appeal. Prosecutors had previously asked for a 15-year prison term. Kim slashed Mark Lippert during a breakfast forum in Seoul, leaving deep gashes on the envoy's face and arm. Lippert, who needed 80 stitches, was treated for five days at a Seoul hospital. Kim has described himself as an anti-US activist. He told police that his assault was meant to protest annual US-South Korean military drills but that he didn't intend to kill the ambassador. Police said Kim attempted to kill Lippert because he knifed him more than twice with a force that was enough to penetrate the ambassador's arm as he tried to block the attack. During earlier police questioning, Kim also said South Korea is a semi-colony of the US, according to Seoul police.

"(Jul 2, 2014  8:30 AM CDT) The rhino-like Triceratops, Greek for  three-horned face,  didn't always embody its name in way we picture it doing. By comparing 50 skulls collected over a 15-year period from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, paleontologists have learned that it took between 1 million and 2 million years for the large nasal horn it is famous for today to fully develop, while what started as a long beak shortened over that same time period, the scientists report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Though they've established the evolution, the study's lead author tells USA Today that  it's difficult to say what drove the change.  The first Triceratops skeleton was found in 1887, reports CNN, and was at first thought to be that of a (presumably very large) buffalo. Two years later, a Yale scientist named it Triceratops for its impressive three-horned skull, which the scientists had previously learned changes subtly in shape over the course of a single lifetime as well. A half-million years before their extinction, they roamed the Earth in great numbers, reports UPI, which points out that our understanding of the Triceratops has been greatly boosted by the fact that so many fossils of the creature can be found in the Hell Creek Formation.  We went out and looked at where the fossils came from in context of the rock formation,  the lead author explains.  The ones found low in the formation look different from the ones found high up.

Pallenberg was perhaps best known for her connection to the Rolling Stones—she happily described herself as a hanger-on—for whom she served as a muse. According to the Guardian, Pallenberg got backstage at her first Stones concert in 1965. She supplied guitarist Brian Jones with marijuana and hash and soon started a relationship with him. After Jones reportedly physically abused her, Pallenberg moved on to Keith Richards, with whom she would have three children prior to their split in 1980. Richards has said he was attracted to Pallenberg's artistic sensibility and strength.  I like a high-spirited woman,  the Hollywood Reporter quotes from Richards' memoir.  And with Anita, you knew you were taking on a valkyrie—she who decides who dies in battle.  Pallenberg sang backing vocals on  Sympathy for the Devil,  and Mick Jagger is said to have remixed parts of Beggars Banquet on her input. She starred in the film Performance with Jagger in 1970 while denying the two were having an affair. She also memorably appeared as the Black Queen in Barbarella. Pallenberg kicked a heroin addiction and earned a four-year degree in fashion. She once said a memoir about her life would be too  salacious.","Model, Actor, Rolling Stones Muse Dies at 73","Model, Actor, Rolling Stones Muse Dies at ____",73,Copy( 73 ),0
"(Feb 21, 2017  12:30 PM) It may rhyme with  dud,  but it packs a deadly wallop: A dzud (pronounced 'ZUHD) is an extreme weather phenomenon unique to Mongolia that's characterized by a summer drought and then a prolonged winter of heavy snow and temperatures of minus 40 to minus 59 degrees Fahrenheit. A dzud typically happens once every 12 years, but it has struck for the second consecutive year this winter, and it's putting the livelihoods of more than 150,000 nomadic herders and family members at risk. The dzud last year killed more than 1 million livestock, which are the only source of food, transport, and outside income for almost half of Mongolia's population of 3 million, the Red Cross said last week, as it launched an emergency appeal. More than 40,000 cows and other livestock have already died this time, a figure that's expected to jump in the freezing months ahead and into spring when animals are still weak. Many herder families will lose their livestock and livelihoods  and will have no choice but to migrate to the slum areas on the outskirts of [the capital, Ulaanbaatar] and other urban centers where they will face great social and economic hardship,  said the head of the Beijing office of the International Federation of Red Cross. The Red Cross said 70% of the country is covered by snow, and 157,000 people belonging to herder households in 17 of Mongolia's 21 provinces are at risk. The agency appealed for $650,000 to help 2,740 of the most at-risk families, reports the AP.",A 'Dzud' Comes Every 12 Years. Except for This Time,A 'Dzud' Comes Every ____ Years.

"(Nov 8, 2017  6:03 AM) Five days before killing 26 people inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Devin Patrick Kelley rubbed elbows with the congregation at the church's annual fall festival. Attendees were surprised to see him with his children at the event—which included a bouncy house and petting zoo—since he was feuding with his mother-in-law from his most recent marriage in 2014. Michelle Shields, who attended the church, was estranged from her daughter, Danielle Shields, who worked there, reports the Houston Chronicle. But  they thought, 'oh this is good. This is progress,'  says a friend of the mother-in-law, adding that Michelle Shields was particularly pleased to see Kelley with her grandchildren. Shortly after 11am Sunday, however, Kelley appeared on a mission to  take care of the mother-in-law,  a commander of the Texas Department of Public Safety tells NBC News, when he emptied 15 30-round magazines inside First Baptist Church. Shields was not inside, but a witness says Kelley yelled,  Everybody die [expletive],  per KSAT. Kelley's troubled past has emerged in the aftermath: He tried to sneak guns onto Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, made death threats against superiors, and escaped a psychiatric hospital after assaulting his then-wife and infant son. He was also accused of rape in 2013, though the investigation halted when Kelley moved out of state; he pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in 2014, per BuzzFeed and CNN.",Killer Was at Church Festival 5 Days Before Shooting,Killer Was at Church Festival ____ Days Before Shooting,5,Trans( Five ),1

"(Mar 6, 2019  10:30 AM) If you were left feeling concerned after Luke Perry's death after a stroke at age 52, wondering if you, too, are at risk at such a young age—you're not alone. Articles abound in the wake of his death explaining that strokes can happen at any age. But, as the New York Times explains, the  vast majority  of strokes do, in fact, occur in  much older people.  When strokes do occur in younger patients, there are often different causes than those found in older patients. According to two experts who spoke to the Times, those causes can include such uber-specific events as a chiropractic adjustment, sports incident, or roller coaster ride causing an artery to tear and a blood clot to form and travel to the brain. And when strokes do occur in younger people, whose brains have not yet shrunk as they will in older adulthood, they are more at risk of fatal brain swelling, doctors tell USA Today. There are other, less freaky-sounding causes of stroke in the young as well: a hole in the heart, which about 25% of people possess and which makes some of those people more vulnerable to a stroke; a genetic mutation making certain people more prone to blood clots that travel to the brain; a heart defect or rhythm disturbance that causes clots to form and travel to the brain; certain drugs that cause arteries to suddenly narrow or close, cutting off blood flow to the brain; or an aneurysm. Kara Swisher writes in the Times that she, too, had a stroke, at age 49, with none of the usual warning signs such as high blood pressure; in her case, it was a transient ischemic attack, often referred to as a mini-stroke, brought about by the aforementioned hole in the heart, blood prone to clotting, and a long flight to Hong Kong.

But with China and Japan already investing heavily in high-speed rail, Biden countered,  If we do not, you tell me how America is going to be able to lead the world in the 21st century.  Biden—who described the plan as the country's biggest investment in rail since Abraham Lincoln began the transcontinental railroad—says the project to build new rail networks and make existing ones faster will create jobs and help America compete internationally, reports Reuters.

That was the caption, police say, of one social media post about 14-year-old British Columbia teen Carson Crimeni—who did not, in fact, end up surviving. He was found alone and unresponsive in a Langley Township skate park Wednesday night, and could not be revived. Police think someone gave the teen drugs and then left him to die; they say other posts included video of him as he overdosed, the CBC reports. Carson's grandfather, who was the one to find the boy after his family became concerned he was not responding to phone calls, says he saw some of the social media posts that included video of his grandson in distress as others laugh. Witnesses reported seeing a group of boys taunting another boy who looked ill, CTV News reports. Carson's dad says his son was happy, loved hockey, and often played World of Warcraft with his dad.

Kiana was able to get her life jacket on and get the life jackets for her father, who was in shock, and her sister, who's still recovering from a bout with cancer. That's when Kiana knew she was the one who'd have to swim to shore, which she couldn't even see, for help.  I was sad to leave my sister and my dad behind, but I felt like it was the right thing to do,  she tells the Sentinel. The high school senior told herself not to look back at her family and just to keep moving forward through the cold water; after what  seemed like forever,  per the paper, she made it to shore. She'd struggled through 600 yards of choppy water, or the equivalent of six football fields. From the shoreline, Kiana managed to flag down a party boat, and that boat and another vessel rescued Cierrah and the girls' father. EMTs checked all three, who were relatively fine: Other than being cold, there were apparently no other injuries, other than a few scrapes on Kiana's feet and legs. As for Cierrah, she took away her own life lesson from the experience.  I think I learned that I really would not like to die,  she says.

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence—including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard—were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there  to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,  reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO.

Joseph Orbeso, 21, and Rachel Nguyen, 20, of Orange County, Calif., haven't been seen or heard from since setting out on a hike on Thursday, park rep George Land tells the Orange County Register. Their car was found in the northwest area of the park on Friday after the owner of a bed and breakfast in which the couple were staying found they'd failed to check out. Fresh tracks leading from the vehicle suggested they headed north into a canyon, per NPR. However, the tracks also  indicate these people could be walking in circles,  says Land. Of particular concern is the temperature inside the park, which hit 100 degrees on Thursday. There's been no relief for 100 people and K-9 units who've scoured thousands of miles since then. As California Highway Patrol and the US Border Patrol provided air support on Monday, some rescuers even had to be removed from the park because of the heat, reports the Los Angeles Times. The search was scaled back Tuesday due to thunderstorms but was expected to resume Wednesday morning. It will continue until the end of the week, says Land, though he doesn't appear optimistic.

Police say the suspect attacked a man and a woman with a machete on a section of trail in Virginia early Saturday, killing the man and severely injuring the woman, WSLS reports. Wythe County Sheriff Keith Dunagan says the woman pretended to be dead, then took off running when the suspect, James Jordan, walked away after his dog, reports the Washington Post. The woman walked six miles before encountering another group of hikers, who called for help. The sheriff says officers found Jordan and the victim with GPS technology after the man managed to trigger an SOS signal on his phone. Jordan—who went by the name  Sovereign  on the trail—faces federal charges of murder and assault with intent to murder. Appalachian Trail Conservancy spokesman Brian King tells the Daily Beast that Jordan had become  well known  on the trail in recent weeks for threatening hikers. King says Jordan was arrested, fined, and released after an altercation with hikers on the Tennessee/North Carolina border in late April. Authorities say that before Saturday's attack, Jordan threatened a group of four hikers who were camped out. Two fled north and reported the attack to authorities.

In 2013, the former South Carolina police officer was accused of barging into a North Charleston home and tasing a resident, Mario Givens, for no apparent reason. Givens tells his story in an AP exclusive, recalling that after he answered the pre-dawn knock, Slager wouldn't tell him why he wanted to come in and finally shoved the door open. Givens raised his arms over his head, but says Slager tased him anyway. (The Daily Beast notes that North Charleston cops have been called out for using Tasers excessively, and disproportionately so on black people.) Another officer came in and both dragged Givens outside, threw him to the ground, and cuffed him, he says. He was put in a squad car and accused of resisting the police, but was ultimately released without charge and filed a formal complaint the next day. Slager had gone to the house because Maleah Kiara Brown, the ex of Givens' brother Matthew, had reported waking up in her own nearby home to find Matthew Givens in her bedroom. She went with the officers to the Givens home and, she tells the AP, she screamed to the officers that they had the wrong man—she had provided them with a description of Matthew, 5-foot-5; Mario is over 6 feet tall. She agrees with Mario Givens that he was not resisting when he was tased. She told a police supervisor what she witnessed, but none of those details made it into the investigative report after Givens complained—she says that she was never contacted as part of the internal investigation. Givens says he wasn't either, nor were other witnesses who had also contacted police and were willing to give statements, and when he went to ask the status six weeks after complaining, he was told the case had been closed.

Lin-Manuel Miranda's hip-hop-flavored biography about the first US treasury secretary broke the 15-nominations record Tuesday held by The Producers and Billy Elliot.

But, as the headline of Linda Bloodworth Thomason's piece notes,  not all harassment is sexual.  Rather, Moonves carried out a  personal vendetta  to keep Bloodworth Thomason's shows off the network and keep her out of work for seven years right at the  pinnacle  of her career, she alleges. Before he took over, her shows were celebrated by CBS execs and she was given  carte blanche  to tackle such subjects as sexual harassment and domestic violence. Then in 1995, three years after she was given the largest writing and producing contract in the network's history at $50 million, Moonves took the reins. He proceeded to decline all of her pilots, all while keeping her hope alive that eventually something would end up on air. She doesn't know why he sidelined her, though she wonders if her shows'  admittedly aggressive, feminist agenda  had something to do with it. Over the years, she watched as he turned CBS from a network that championed strong female characters to a network full of  macho crime shows featuring a virtual genocide of dead naked hotties in morgue drawers.  And so she bids Moonves good riddance, writing she's  happy to dance on his professional grave.  To all the sexual predators in the entertainment industry, she warns,  We are not going to stop until every last one of you is gone. We don't care anymore if you go to jail or go to hell.

South Africa tweeted back:  South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past.  Reuters describes the tweet as  hav[ing] inflamed an already high-octane debate over land in South Africa, a country that remains deeply racially divided and unequal.  Per the Guardian, South Africa is 8% white, but white farmers hold 72% of the land.  The majority of South Africans want to see land reform. The majority of our farmers, white and black, want to be a part of this initiative,  a rep for President Cyril Ramaphosa told CNN, which notes farm seizures are not currently  ongoing.  Ramaphosa on Aug. 1 said South Africa will move forward with amending the constitution to allow land that had been taken during apartheid to be expropriated without compensation. As for farmer deaths, they're actually at a 20-year low, with 47 killed over 2017-2018; the toll stood at 153 in 1998. Attacks on farms are up, however. The Washington Post reports it's the first time Trump has used the word  Africa  in a tweet as president, and adds that the post of US ambassador to South Africa is currently vacant.",Trump's 1st Tweet to Reference Africa Gets Poor Reception,Trump's ____st Tweet to Reference Africa Gets Poor Reception,1,Copy( 1 ),0

"(Aug 12, 2017  3:52 PM CDT) In March 1945, 83 German prisoners of war escaped a prison camp in South Wales. It was the biggest escape of German prisoners during World War II, and now—thanks to a report published earlier this month in the Journal of Conflict Archaeology—we know how they did it. Camp 198 in Bridgend was built to house 1,600 German officers and was one of what were ultimately 1,026 camps—numbered sequentially—in the UK, the Conversation reports. The conditions at Camp 198 no doubt made escape not only inviting but also possible: The report notes  camp security measures were generally poor,  with  lack of either sentry towers and perimeter fence lighting, and this provided good cover for escape tunnels to be constructed.  Researchers using ground-based surface scanning, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistivity discovered the location of a tunnel originating in Camp 198's Hut 9, which was preserved for scientists to study when the rest of the camp was demolished in the 1990s. The tunnel was relatively shallow—less than 5 feet below ground. And while its entrance was sealed by concrete, the inside was  remarkably intact,  with the walls and ceiling still supported by bed posts and other items from the prisoners' huts. Researchers also found a false wall in a shower room behind which the prisoners had hidden the dirt removed from the tunnel. None of the 83 German POWs who escaped Camp 198 made it back to Germany.

No, this particular coin that went to auction Thursday evening in Tampa, Fl., sold for just under $2 million. The 1894-S dime was struck at the San Francisco Mint. Only 24 were made, and only nine likely still exist.  There's a couple of iconic rarities in the rare coin market,  says David Hall, co-founder of Professional Coin Grading Service.  A couple of coins have been known among the rarest of the rare for 100 years and this is one of those numismatic icons.  Hall says so few of those dimes were made at the San Francisco Mint because the country was in a recession that year and more dimes weren't needed. Heritage Auctions, which conducted the auction, says an experienced collector who wishes to remain anonymous outbid 15 others vying for the piece during the Florida United Numismatists Show and paid $1,997,500. In an effort to track down some of the other long-missing 1894-S dimes, Heritage Auctions is offering a $10,000 reward to be the first to examine any previously unreported, genuine examples of the coins.  They could be in somebody's desk drawer. They could be sitting in somebody's bank box. People could look almost anywhere and they might show up,  says a senior numismatist at Heritage Auctions.

"(Dec 28, 2015  5:28 AM) Ellsworth Kelly, widely seen as one of the greatest artists America has ever produced, has died at his home in upstate New York after 70 years of creating his own style of abstract art. He was 92. Kelly started out in an artistic US Army unit in France during World War II, designing camouflage patterns and creating fake tanks to deceive the Germans about the size of Allied forces, NPR reports. After the war, he returned to Paris to study art under the GI Bill, creating what Vulture calls a  uniquely American study of abstraction, form, and color  despite his distance from US contemporaries. In the '50s, he returned to New York, where art historian Sarah Rich tells NPR he was put off by the  corny expressionism and epic self-importance  of other leading abstract painters. Kelly told the New York Times in 1996 that he started out painting things like patterns seen on sidewalk grates before moving to purely abstract paintings.  I wondered, 'Can I make a painting with just five panels of color in a row?'  he said.  I loved it, but I didn't think the world would. They'd think, 'It's not enough.'  His reputation grew over the decades as his style continued to evolve, and his paintings and sculptures can now be found in almost every major museum of modern art, NPR notes. He also created many public installations over the years, including a stirring installation at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.

In 2008, just 6% of GOP primary campaign advertising attacked other Republicans, but this year that figure has shot to 51%, the Washington Post reports. The tone of the ads has gotten worse too; in 2008, one Mitt Romney attack ad was sure to call John McCain an  honorable man.  This year's ads aren’t nearly so nice; one Gingrich ad, for instance, accuses Romney of taking  blood money.  The driving force behind these attacks: super PACs. Since these groups can't coordinate with their chosen candidates, they have to rely on stock footage.  If they didn't run comparison or contrast ads, they would have some very boring television,  says one GOP ad man. Plus, candidates needn't  approve this message  on super PAC ads, making attacks less dangerous. Still, the strategy isn't without its pitfalls—one GOP strategist notes that Romney and his super PAC have run the most negative ads, and  his favorable impression among independents has collapsed.","Stats Prove It: 2012 Race Much, Much Nastier","Stats Prove It: ____ Race Much, Much Nastier",2012,Copy( 2012 ),0
"(Mar 29, 2017  7:09 AM CDT) Two anti-abortion activists whose secretly recorded conversations with executives from Planned Parenthood made national headlines are each facing 15 felony charges in California, reports the Los Angeles Times. David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt posed as executives of a fake bioresearch company and filmed their conversations with Planned Parenthood officials about obtaining fetal tissue. They posted the resulting videos in 2015 via the Center for Medical Progress, accusing Planned Parenthood of being in the business of illegally harvesting and selling organs from aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood says the videos were deceptively edited. Now, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has charged the pair with filming 14 people without their permission, plus an additional count of conspiracy to invade privacy.  The right to privacy is a cornerstone of California’s Constitution, and a right that is foundational in a free democratic society,  said Becerra.  We will not tolerate the criminal recording of confidential conversations.  Daleiden called the charges  bogus  and tells the Washington Post that he and Merritt were engaged in  citizen journalism.  Similar charges against the pair in Texas were eventually dropped. Planned Parenthood, for its part, faced investigations in about a dozen states over the videos, but those have resulted in no charges.  As we have said from the beginning ...

A Change.org petition calling on HBO to remake the eighth and final season of the show  with competent writers  launched last Thursday and saw a huge spike in support this week, reports People. It went from 15,000 signatures to more than 250,000 on Wednesday alone, per CNBC. As of Thursday morning, more than 360,000 had signed the petition claiming showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss are  woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material (i.e. the books) to fall back on.  By 9am EDT Friday, that number was nearly 800,000. Sunday's penultimate episode riled critics, with the Guardian's Sarah Hughes noting  it felt as though Benioff and Weiss were doing little more than gleefully destroying the world they once carefully depicted.

The ACLU and US Rep. Joaquin Castro said that Rosa Maria Hernandez was returned Friday afternoon to her family, the AP reports. Her parents brought her into the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was a toddler, and they live in the Texas border city of Laredo. A cousin who is an American citizen took Rosa Maria from Laredo to a children's hospital in Corpus Christi on Oct. 24, where she was scheduled to have emergency gallbladder surgery. To get to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles away, she had to pass through an interior checkpoint in South Texas operated by the Border Patrol. Border Patrol agents followed Rosa Maria and the cousin to the hospital, then took the girl into custody after the surgery and transported her to a facility in San Antonio for unaccompanied immigrant minors, under the custody of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The Border Patrol has said it had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission. The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria's behalf Tuesday, argued that the US government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and endangered Rosa Maria's health by not sending her home.

"(Nov 13, 2014  7:05 AM) You can start believing in magic again, because not only are fanged deer real, it turns out unicorns are, too. Well, sort of. In August, a hunter shot an elderly roe deer bearing a single, centered antler in the forests of Slovenia, reports National Geographic. It's not uncommon to find deer with just a  spike —what a remaining antler is called after one is lost; even an injury to a buck's hind leg can cause an abnormality. But in this case, both antlers had fused into one, giving a unicorn-like appearance. This was a first for scientist Boštjan Pokorny, who confirmed the roe deer's fantastical and  untypical  deformity, which National Geographic notes was probably caused by an injury sustained as the antlers were forming, which is an annual occurrence. The roe deer lived to be quite old and was a little pudgy, leading Pokorny to infer his unusual deformity didn't hold him back in life. Meanwhile, on another continent, another hunter also recently bagged a  unicorn deer.  KULR reports Amy Calkins shot what she thought was her first buck in Washington state in mid-October—except it turned out to be a doe with a single antler. Calkins posted photos on Facebook of the deer and its four teats, and she says she later learned that a hormone imbalance caused the unusual growth. Mississippi State University's Deer Lab notes that it's  difficult to identify the particular cause of a particular buck's (or doe's) abnormality without a detailed dissection or necropsy.  It's unclear if one occurred in this case. (A unicorn deer was famously spotted in Italy in 2008.)",'Unicorn Deer' Found on 2 Continents,'Unicorn Deer' Found on ____ Continents,2,Trans( both ),1

Syria, meanwhile, blamed  armed groups who took advantage of peaceful gatherings  for the casualties and put the toll at 17. The National Organization for Human Rights in Syria said most of the deaths occurred in the northern province of Idlib and the central region of Homs. Yesterday, thousands of Syrians defied an unrelenting government crackdown and flooded streets across the country to buttress their two-month uprising against the country's authoritarian regime. Authorities responded with live ammunition, causing the large number of casualties, right groups say.

After three years in a Chinese prison for allegedly assaulting a man during a bar fight, Brown returned home Wednesday to the hugs and smiling faces of his loved ones, the AP reports. Outside of his family's brick house on Detroit's east side, he took a few moments to reflect on regaining his freedom.  We don't really understand that word to its fullest extent until (we're) without it,  Brown said.  Hallelujah! I'm free!  Brown, 32, was hesitant Wednesday to discuss the Chongqing bar incident, which he referred to as a  minor altercation,  or his treatment in prison.  I'm just very fortunate that it's over,  he said, adding that he will soon head to Florida to see his 12-year-old son. Brown, who played at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Detroit and Ball State University in Indiana, was teaching English and coaching American football in southwestern China when he was arrested in September 2016 and charged with intentional assault. Brown, who was the only person prosecuted over the incident, denied hitting the man and said he was defending himself after being attacked. And witnesses said Brown was being harassed by other patrons. However, the court ruled that he  didn't do enough to de-escalate the situation,  according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based rights monitoring group. Brown was sentenced to four years in prison, but a Chinese court later reduced it to three years, saying that was due to apologies and expressions of forgiveness between Brown and others involved in the fight, as well as Brown's payment of $28,750 in compensation.",US Football Player Released After 3 Years in Chinese Prison,US Football Player Released After ____ Years in Chinese Prison,3,Trans( three ),1

Officials said Sunday that use of 2,990 Vievu-brand LE-5 cameras has been suspended because of the incident in a Staten Island station house, NBC News reports. Police say the officer was on his way out for a midnight shift early Sunday when he noticed smoke coming out of the device, NY1 reports. It exploded after he removed it from his shirt but the officer wasn't injured, police say. The explosion  revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite,  police say.

"(Jun 27, 2018  2:32 PM CDT) For some 3.2 million Americans who work in the private sector, it has apparently seemed like a good deal: Lock in their monthly federal student-loan payments at 10% of their discretionary income. Make those payment for 20 years (25 if it's graduate school debt, notes Forbes). Hit that date and see whatever is left wiped away—and there might be a ton left, as the payments are often smaller than the interest that's being accrued. The Wall Street Journal reports these  income-driven repayment plans  have been available through the Education Department since 2007, meaning balances won't start going to zero until 2027. And when they do, expect a  bomb.  That's because the balance that's forgiven is considered income for that year, meaning the borrower has to pay tax on it. The Journal does the math: One estimate expects such borrowers to have $41,000 forgiven on average. At a 25% income tax rate, that would mean a $10,250 tax bill. On the more eye-popping end of the spectrum, it references an orthodontist it interviewed who had student-loan debt in excess of $1 million; that associated tax bill could be $700,000. (Forbes notes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program doesn't levy taxes on the forgiven amount).  I'm very doubtful that everybody is going to be able to make these tax payments,  said Constantine Yannelis, who worked in the Treasury Department under Obama. The IRS could place liens on homes or garnish Social Security checks, but some experts expect that as 2027 approaches, Congress will see heavy pressure to act; eliminating the tax could put taxpayers on the hook for billions in student-loan costs.",A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in 2027,A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in ____,2027,Copy( 2027 ),0

"(Feb 26, 2019  12:38 PM) Being able to say,  The baby is finally sleeping through the night  may offer a mental boost, but that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be getting a lot more shut-eye anytime soon. In fact, don't count on it for at least six years, the Telegraph reports, based on a new study out of the University of Warwick that found parents were still somewhat sleep-deprived a half-dozen years after their bundle of joy showed up. The study, published in the journal Sleep, pored over the sleep patterns from 2008 to 2015 of more than 4,600 parents who'd welcomed a new baby. Not surprisingly, the first three months are the worst, sucking an average of an hour a night away from a new mom's sleep, while new dads lost an average of 15 minutes, per a release. But when the little ones got to the ages of between 4 and 6, researchers found the parents were still sleeping less than they did before they'd conceived: 20 minutes less per night, on average, for the mothers, and (still) 15 minutes less for dads. Sleep deprivation took a stronger hold on first-time parents than on those who'd done this routine before. Study co-author Sakari Lemola offers a theory on why Mr. Sandman still seems to elude parents of preschoolers:  While having children is a major source of joy for most parents, it is possible that increased demands and responsibilities associated with the role as a parent lead to shorter sleep and decreased sleep quality,  even long after the crib has been stored in the garage.

"(Apr 5, 2017  5:49 PM CDT) Fire officials found Robert Wylie banging on the door of the fire department, holding his 13-year-old son's unconscious body. But the doses of Narcan they administered couldn't save the teen. Nathan Wylie died of a suspected heroin overdose on Saturday, four days after he was taken to a Dayton, Ohio, hospital, reports the Dayton Daily News. Officials say Nathan had access to drugs because his father is an addict. Wylie had already been arrested for child endangerment after another minor who lived at Wylie's home sent a relative a photo of white powder, a razor blade, and a crack pipe in the home in Feb. 2016, police say. He was later arrested for drug possession after he was found with heroin and crack cocaine during a traffic stop in December, with Nathan in the backseat, police say, per CBS News. It isn't clear why Nathan remained at the residence. A rep for Montgomery County Children Services tells the Daily News only that there was  a case open with this family  and that Nathan's sibling was removed from the home following Nathan's death. After Nathan was taken to the hospital—a witness told officials Wylie  was on drugs and the boy got into his stuff,  per WXIX—Wylie was again arrested on suspicion of child endangerment. The 40-year-old was released in that case on Thursday. However, he remains in Montgomery County Jail in relation to the December case. Wylie's live-in girlfriend, Tina Davis—who was previously charged in the February case—faces new charges of drunk driving and drug possession after an arrest on Sunday.

"(Apr 2, 2015  12:37 PM CDT) More than 750 plaintiffs are suing the Johns Hopkins Hospital System Corp. over its role in a series of medical experiments in Guatemala in the 1940s and 1950s during which subjects were infected with venereal diseases. The lawsuit in Baltimore seeks $1 billion in damages for individuals infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases through a US government program between 1945 and 1956, plus spouses and children of people infected.  Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the US Government's Guatemala study and its legacy,  a Hopkins rep tells the Baltimore Sun.  This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs' counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain.  The suit claims Johns Hopkins officials had  substantial influence  over the studies, controlling some advisory panels, and were involved in planning and authorizing the experiments. An attorney for Hopkins calls the suit  baseless.  It's the latest in a series of lawsuits over the studies.

"(Oct 25, 2017  1:24 PM CDT) Professional poker champ Phil Ivey won't be getting the $10.2 million he thought he won from a London casino, the Guardian reports. The 40-year-old, whom the BBC calls  the Tiger Woods of poker,  was found to have cheated in order to win the money while playing a version of baccarat at Crockfords Club in Mayfair in 2012. He's been fighting to get the millions ever since, insisting the strategy he used to win wasn't illegal. His case against Genting Casinos UK, the owner of Crockfords, was dismissed last year, and he challenged that dismissal. But on Wednesday, Britain's Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, the AP reports. Ivey and a colleague used a technique called  edge sorting,  in which they got the croupier to unknowingly arrange the cards in a way that allowed Ivey and the other player to figure out what cards were being dealt, based on small differences in the pattern on the back of the cards, and bet accordingly. Crockfords returned his stake but never paid out the winnings, leading to the court battle. The Supreme Court found what Ivey did was definitely cheating, but after the ruling Ivey maintained his innocence.  At the time I played at Crockfords, I believed that edge sorting was a legitimate advantage-play technique, and I believe that more passionately than ever today,  he said.

"(Apr 29, 2015  12:23 PM CDT) A Texas inmate on death row had his execution stayed yesterday just three hours before it was scheduled to be carried out. Robert Pruett, initially sentenced to 99 years in prison as an accomplice to a 1995 murder when he was 15, was then sentenced to death in 2002 over the 1999 killing of guard Daniel Nagle at a prison near Corpus Christi, but he maintains he was framed. Pruett, now 35, had been punished for eating in an unauthorized area and the disciplinary report was found torn up near Nagle's body with traces of what one DNA test revealed was Nagle's blood. A judge halted yesterday's scheduled lethal injection so DNA testing could be performed on a metal shank used to stab the guard, the Guardian reports. The test should be completed by May 28, Reuters reports. In halting the execution, Judge Bert Richardson said that though attempts by Pruett's lawyers to delay his death  appear to be unreasonable, it is not clear they, in fact, are unreasonable.  A Texas Department of Criminal Justice rep tells the AP Pruett was  excited to hear the news.  Pruett argues he was framed for Nagle's murder just as he was about to file a grievance describing corruption and safety concerns at the prison. His blood or fingerprints have not been found on the shank so far, nor was Nagle's blood found on Pruett, though several inmates testified against him; some were rewarded with better treatment. Pruett's lawyers say their client wasn't given adequate legal advice during sentencing and allege evidence was damaged because it wasn't properly stored.","3 Hours Before Execution, Texas Killer Gets Stay","____ Hours Before Execution, Texas Killer Gets Stay",3,Trans( three ),1

On every issue, Obama stuck to the  loose, easy style  that marked his campaign. As the world panicked about a possible flu pandemic, the president once again played it calm—sounding a bit like  the pediatrician in chief.  Throughout day 100 Obama stuck to one message: that he and his team were hard at work fixing Bush-era problems, primarily the economy. But it was style as much as substance that was on display last night:  a calm president, coolly giving the appearance that he would help the country recover from the state it's in.

It turns out, that security breach was much bigger and much worse than possibly anyone realized. According to Motherboard, 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords taken as part of the same breach were just put up for sale by a hacker named  Peace,  who is seeking $2,200 for them on the dark web. LinkedIn has confirmed the emails and passwords are legit and is working on contacting affected users. Back in 2012, LinkedIn never specified how many accounts had been compromised by hackers. Ars Technica reports it's possible even the company didn't know how many passwords had been stolen initially. Hackers have apparently had no trouble with the lightly encrypted passwords. One source claims hackers cracked 90% of the stolen passwords within 72 hours. Ars Technica argues many of the passwords should never have been allowed by LinkedIn in the first place.

While some of the ads expressly mentioned Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, the majority simply promoted  divisive  views on things like gun and gay rights, discrimination, and immigration. According to Reuters, the ads were linked to 470  inauthentic  accounts and pages that have since been suspended. While Facebook isn't releasing the ads, the names of the suspended pages featured words like  patriot  and  refugee,  the Guardian reports. The Russian company linked to the ads has a history of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda. Facebook said it also found $50,000 spent on 2,200  potentially politically related  ads that may be tied to Russia. The company's findings are more evidence to back the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia influenced the election. The findings are also likely to make investigators question whether the Russians were getting input on ad buys from people in the US. The ad buys may have been a violation of US election law by Facebook and others involved.  It is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state, or local election, directly or indirectly,  a member of the US Federal Election Commission tells Reuters.

(Not including a driver who does something  really, really stupid,  as CNN puts it.) Engineers already have some ground to stand on, given that not a single person has died in the Volvo XC90 over the past four years. And while it's in an elite squad, that model isn't alone—eight others claim the distinction. To reach its goal, Volvo (and other car makers working on similar safety features, including Ford and Tesla) is leaning heavily on autonomous technologies, reports Extreme Tech. Some of the features are run-of-the-mill—think better air bags and restraints—while others are more advanced, including adaptive cruise control, pedestrian and large animal detection, sign reading, and an assist to keep the vehicle between lane lines.  Still, claiming something to be death-proof seems risky,  notes the Extreme Tech post.  They said the Titanic was unsinkable, after all.  Meanwhile, a review in Automobile Magazine calls the XC90 the  future of luxury transportation  with  crisp  handling and steering that provides  decent feedback.  It also notes that Volvo is planning to test its latest autonomy technology on 30 miles of highway in Sweden next year, while the Obama administration recently announced a $4 billion pilot program to study the tech further.

Second president John Adams tops the list with 9,893, while Revolutionary War financier Robert Morris comes in second at 7,367 (perhaps both are a coincidence given John and Robert as well as Adams and Morris are common to begin with). Congressman and famous signature-writer John Hancock, meanwhile, claims a far more modest (but likely more intentional) 1,616 namesakes, ranking a distant third.  It's interesting to note that the top two most common names, John Adams and Robert Morris, are most popular in Florida,  says Liz Powell, culture and trend expert from WhitePages, in a news release.  While Florida may have been the 27th state to enter the Union, it is the number one state for patriotic names.  Only one name, meanwhile, belongs to a woman (WhitePages admits she wasn't a Founding Father but gave her a spot all the same), and that's seamstress Betsy Ross.

The company previously announced the recall of 1.6 million cars, only through the 2007 model year, which were built with the faulty switch. The recall involves six cars: the Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac G5, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion, and Saturn Sky. GM says it sold 95,000 faulty switches to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers for use as replacement parts. Of those, 90,000 were used to repair vehicles from the 2003-2007 model years. But 5,000 of the switches were used to fix cars from the 2008-2011 model years. GM said it doesn't know which cars got those 5,000 switches, so it needs to recall all of them. Of the cars being added to the recall, 824,000 were sold in the US. The ignition switches can move out of the  run  position and cause the car's engine to stall. It can also knock out power steering and power brakes, making the vehicle harder to maneuver, and disable the air bags. GM has said the defect is linked to at least 12 deaths in cars from the 2003-2007 models years, though a watchdog group puts the figure much higher.

"(Feb 12, 2017  1:43 PM) The Grammy's will surely be scrambling to pull together a tribute to a seven-time winner in time for Sunday night's show. R&B and jazz great Al Jarreau died Sunday morning at age 76, reports Rolling Stone, whose obituary notes that he was dubbed the  Acrobat of Scat  over the course of a career that spanned five decades. Some of his more popular hits include  We're in This Love Together  and the theme for the TV show Moonlighting. Jarreau was hospitalized last week in Los Angeles for exhaustion, and his Facebook page then announced that he would never tour again. Jarreau collaborated with jazz giants including Miles Davis, David Sanborn, and Chick Corea, and put out 20 albums. The Milwaukee native is the only vocalist to win a Grammy in the jazz, R&B, and pop categories, notes the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A family statement asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music. No cause of death has been announced.

"(Oct 1, 2013  5:28 PM CDT) It was bad enough when reports emerged that poachers had killed about 40 elephants in a Zimbabwe national park by poisoning their watering holes. But now the death toll is 91 and still rising. Massive bones, some already bleached by the blistering sun in the Hwange National Park, litter the landscape around one remote watering hole where 18 carcasses were found. Officials say cyanide used in gold mining was spread by poachers over flat  salt pans,  also known as natural, mineral-rich salt licks. They say lions, hyenas, and vultures have died from feeding on contaminated carcasses or drinking nearby. The poachers are after the elephants' ivory, of course, a trade that Quartz estimates to be worth between $7 billion to $10 billion a year thanks to booming interest in China and other Asian nations. Worse, terrorist groups such as al-Shabab—the network behind the mall attack in Kenya—get up to 40% of their money through the trade.  Poisoning is not really common as a means to kill elephants but, unfortunately, in recent years we have seen more instances,  says one expert.

Casinos don't mind the games, either.  Their house edge is bigger  on them, one slots expert told the AP. Many casinos say penny slots are providing the only revenue on the rise. States are winning too: Missouri raked in half of all casino revenue from penny slots last year, and Nevada drew one quarter of slot revenue from the machines.

"(May 15, 2015  1:56 AM CDT) BB King, whose scorching guitar licks and heartfelt vocals made him the idol of generations of musicians and fans while earning him the nickname  King of the Blues,  died late last night at home in Las Vegas. He was 89. His attorney tells the AP that King died peacefully in his sleep. Although he had continued to perform well into his 80s, the 15-time Grammy winner suffered from diabetes and had been in declining health during the past year. He collapsed during a concert in Chicago last October, later blaming dehydration and exhaustion. For most of a career spanning nearly 70 years and more than 50 albums, King was not only the undisputed king of the blues, but a mentor to scores of guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Otis Rush, Jimi Hendrix, and Keith Richards. A preacher uncle taught him to play, and he honed his technique in abject poverty in the Mississippi Delta, the birthplace of the blues.  I've always tried to defend the idea that the blues doesn't have to be sung by a person who comes from Mississippi, as I did,  he said in 1988.  People all over the world have problems. And as long as people have problems, the blues can never die.  Still, the Delta's influence was undeniable. King began picking cotton on tenant farms around Indianola, Miss., before he was a teenager and was still working off sharecropping debts after he got out of the Army during World War II.

Ronald Bert Smith Jr., 45, was pronounced dead at 11:05pm, about 30 minutes after the procedure began at the state prison in southwest Alabama. Smith was convicted of capital murder in the Nov. 8, 1994, fatal shooting of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. A jury voted 7-5 to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, but a judge overrode that recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. Smith, who pistol-whipped Wilson and shot him in the head, replied,  No ma'am  when asked by the prison warden if he had any final words. US Supreme Court justices put the execution on hold twice Thursday as Smith's attorneys argued for a delay, saying a judge shouldn't have been able to impose the death penalty when a jury recommended he receive life imprisonment. Four liberal justices said they would have halted the execution, but five were needed to do so. As the execution began, Smith heaved and coughed repeatedly, clenching his fists and raising his head, the AP reports. A prison guard performed two consciousness checks before the final two lethal drugs were administered. During the first one, Smith moved his arm, according to the AP.

Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects.  I have no idea how she survived,  one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment:  She didn't do what she was supposed to do,  he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a  corrective counter action  to make her parachute  stop turning.

He said all seven people killed resided at the property, which police rushed to early Friday after receiving a phone call from somebody Dawson described as a  male person  connected to the property.

"(Feb 1, 2010  11:54 AM) In 1970, the Man Booker Prize went to a book published in 1969, but the rules changed in 1971 and the coveted prize was awarded to a book published that year—meaning no 1970 novel scored a Booker. Organizers plan to right the perceived wrong by awarding the Lost Man Booker Prize to one of a number of  remarkable  titles from the forgotten year, the BBC reports. Iris Murdoch, Melvyn Bragg, and Joe Orton are among the longlisted authors. A shortlist will be selected in March by three judges who, oddly enough, were all too young to read in 1970; the public can then vote for the winner, to be announced in May, online.  Our longlist demonstrates that 1970 was a remarkable year for fiction written in English,  says the prize’s literary director.  Recognition for these novels and the eventual winner is long overdue.

It’s now able to access the faster 3G network, of course, and it sports better sound quality and a GPS chip, so it’s a nice upgrade. But the battery life is much worse, and the price drop is a mirage. The 3G’s price cut is offset by increases in AT&T’s service plan that leave you paying more, not less.

The solid piece of granite—known in Riverside, Calif., simply as  the rock —is making the 60-mile journey from a quarry to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Press-Enterprise reports. Since it’s so large, it requires a specially built 200-foot, 200-wheel trailer and can only travel on city streets, at a rate of about 7 miles per day. The epic move will cost $1.5 million. Cities along the route also had to give clearance for the rock’s trip to LACMA, which commences Aug. 5 and requires that certain utility lines be taken down so the boulder can pass. Upon arrival at its new permanent home, the boulder will be the centerpiece of an exhibit by artist Michael Heizer, who reportedly paid $120,000 for the rock.

Who wouldn't like the idea of changing your life in just three weeks?  asks James Clear at the Huffington Post. Unfortunately, it's also just not true. Clear traces the history of the myth back to a 1960 book by plastic surgeon Maxwell Maltz, who observed that it tended to take patients at least 21 days to adjust to their new faces and other bodily changes—the key words being  at least.  Over time, those words fell away and  21 days  gained fame as the hard-and-fast rule. So how long does it really take? Clear dug up a 2009 study in which researchers followed 96 people as they tried to adopt new habits (example: drinking a bottle of water with lunch). The results? Subjects reported behaviors becoming automatic in an average of 66 days. For some it took as little as 18, but for others it stretched as long as 254. Bottom line: Building habits takes time.  All the '21 Days' hype can make it really easy to think, 'Oh, I'll just do this and it'll be done,'  Clear writes.

"(Mar 20, 2019  9:45 AM CDT) Theresa May formally asked the European Union on Wednesday to postpone Britain's departure from the bloc—due in nine days—until June 30. But a frustrated EU has warned it could keep Britain waiting for an answer. In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, May said the Brexit process  clearly will not be completed before 29 March, 2019,  the date fixed in law two years ago for Britain's departure. The AP reports she said she wanted to set out her reasons for the June 30 request to EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Opposition politicians and pro-EU members of May's Conservative government had urged a longer extension, saying a delay of just a few months could leave Britain once again facing a cliff-edge  no-deal  Brexit this summer. Withdrawing without a deal could mean huge disruption for businesses and people in the UK and the 27 remaining EU countries. But a long extension would infuriate the pro-Brexit wing of May's divided party and would require Britain to participate in May 23-26 elections for the European Parliament. May said that would be unacceptable.  As prime minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30,  she said in the House of Commons, noting a longer delay would result in Parliament spending  endless hours contemplating its navel on Brexit.  A delay to Britain's withdrawal requires the approval of all 27 remaining EU countries—and that's not guaranteed. Any delay that requires Britain to take part in European parliamentary elections would be a major headache for the bloc, and some EU leaders want a short extension to end by May 23, when voting begins.",Theresa May Makes Her Brexit Request Known: June 30,Theresa May Makes Her Brexit Request Known: June ____,30,Copy( 30 ),0

"(Mar 24, 2016  5:55 PM CDT) Japanese whalers sailed to the Antarctic in December with the goal of killing 333 minke whales. Discover reports they returned Thursday having met that goal. Japan signed on to an international moratorium banning whale hunting in 1986 but has since been taking advantage of a loophole that allows killing whales in the name of  scientific research.  In what can only be seen as a particularly bold claim, Japan says it's killing whales as part of research meant to prove there are enough whales for them to hunt commercially. For years the country has insisted most whales aren't actually endangered, seeking to return to hunting whales for food, according to Reuters. But the UN says that's exactly what's happening now under the guise of scientific research. Japan openly admits that the meat from the whales killed in the name of science is used for food, including in school lunches. That prompted the UN to ban Japan's hunt last year, Gizmodo reports. For one year, Japan managed to conduct its research without killing any whales before falling back on claims that killing is necessary. This year's haul was the largest in years. Approximately 90% of the mature female whales killed in this year's hunt were pregnant, which Japan says shows their  breeding situation  is  healthy.

Almost 30% of omnivores wouldn't go out with a vegetarian or vegan, whereas just 4% of vegetarians wouldn't date a meat eater, a Today and Match.com poll finds. Of course, it's not exactly a fair comparison: With only 2% of the US population vegetarian and 3% vegan, they don't have many meat-free dating options. Meanwhile, 66% of the survey's 4,000 respondents find picky eating unattractive. Meat eaters' opposition to dating vegetarians is no big surprise, experts say.  Mankind’s first luxury was meat, and when carnivores share food—what they are sharing is this luxury. It’s more than just cultural, it’s instinctual,  notes an anthropologist.

So investigators exhumed her body three months later, sent her fingers to the Wellington Fingerprints Branch, and reburied her, reports stuff.co.nz. The circumstances surrounding her case remain mysterious, and for decades her fingers were held in the care of New Zealand Police Forensics Collection, used to demonstrate how to care for post-mortem remains. In the 1990s, as forensics procedures evolved, the fingers were sent to the New Zealand Police Museum, and now, at long last, they have been reunited with Fendell in a small ceremony by the sea. Fendell is actually the 33rd out of 37 people whose remains are being repatriated by police, though hers is the first case where living relatives were involved, the New Zealand Police note.  The previous 32 repatriations we have completed have been for individuals who have been unidentifiable or have had no living relatives who could be identified,  the museum's director says. After working their way down the family tree, they found Fendell's great-nephew Brian Collinge, who attended the ceremony.  Jessie wasn't forgotten within the family, however as time went on, less of the family knew her story.

So Politico gathered the  five people who’ve gone deeper on the Donald than anyone else alive  together to get to the bottom of the candidate. The five Trump experts—author Gwenda Blair, Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett, author Harry Hurt, Bloomberg editor Timothy O'Brien, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael D'Antonio—met to discuss their subject at, where else, the Trump Grill at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Topics ranged from Trump's father wishing his son dead while eating hot dogs at Coney Island, to Trump seeing himself as Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, to how everything Trump does is to fill a hole left by the lack of love in his life. But things got really interesting when these  Trumpologists  weighed in as to whether or not Trump will be the next President of the United States of America. Four of the five people who arguably know more about Donald Trump then anyone outside of Trump himself say flat-out he won't be president (and the fifth appears to have bowed out of the conversation by that point).

The US ski team said Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, died in the incident near the Rettenbach glacier near Soelden, the venue for the annual season-opening World Cup races. Berlack, from Franconia, NH, and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers descending from the 3,056-meter Gaislachkogel when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four escaped unhurt. Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures.  Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport—both on the race course and skiing the mountain,  US Ski and Snowboard Association President Tiger Shaw said.  Both of them loved what they did.  Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers following two top-20 finishes at the 2013 US national championships and a spring tryout camp. Astle was invited to train with the development team this season after strong early season results, including two top-10 results at NorAm Cup races last month in Canada.

"(May 18, 2015  9:00 AM CDT) Nurse Aruna Shanbaug was 25 when a cleaner at the Mumbai hospital in which she worked sodomized and choked her with metal dog chains. That was Nov. 27, 1973. Left brain-dead and paralyzed, she was kept alive by doctors at King Edward Memorial Hospital who fed her through a feeding tube for four decades. Six days ago, she developed pneumonia; Shanbaug passed away today, just shy of her 68th birthday, the Times of India reports. While alive, Shanbaug became the face of a euthanasia debate in India, whose Supreme Court denied a request to let her die in 2011, the BBC reports.  My broken, battered baby bird finally flew away,  says Pinki Virani, a journalist and author who filed the case rejected by the Supreme Court and wrote extensively about Shanbaug's plight.  And she gave India a passive euthanasia law before doing so.  Though Virani had hoped the court would order the hospital to stop feeding Shanbaug, it instead sided with hospital bosses, who argued Shanbaug  accepts food ... and responds by facial expressions.  But the BBC notes the case did lead to a loosening of  some restrictions on euthanasia.  A terminally ill patient in India can now be taken off life support in exceptional circumstances if family members want that to happen. (The Wall Street Journal explains that because Shanbaug's parents were dead, the hospital was considered her caregiver, hence the court siding with it.) Her attacker, Sohanlal Bharta Walmiki, served seven years for attempted murder and robbery but was never charged with rape because sodomy wasn't mentioned in India's rape laws.

Didier Seban, a lawyer for Parrish's family, tells the BBC that 75-year-old Michel Fourniret confessed to the 1990 murder of Parrish—as well as the 1988 murder of Marie-Angele Domece, whose body was never found—to judges  two to three times  over the past week.

Fourniret was charged with the murders of Parrish and Domece in 2008 after Olivier said he was responsible for them, only to have the cases dismissed in 2011 after Olivier recanted.

When he returned six weeks later, Jordan had help: specially made Air Jordans, with a strap added to support his injured left foot. A pair worn in a Bulls game is going on the auction block, and TMZ reports the shoes could bring $500,000. The auction company said Jordan wore this pair on March 29, 1986, in a victory over the New York Knicks. They helped him to 24 points in 23 minutes of play. After the game, Jordan autographed the shoes and gave them to a young fan. The fan has kept them all this time, per the Bleacher Report, but decided to sell them after The Last Dance, a documentary on Jordan's last season with the Bulls, aired. The modified Air Jodans were never sold to the public. Bidding runs July 22 through July 31.

"(May 2, 2019  11:05 AM CDT) Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball's 3-year-old son, Noah, has leukemia. But his parents don't want him to get chemotherapy, and they've lost custody of him as a result.  We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,  Bland-Ball tells WFLA.  Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.  After the Florida couple left Hillsborough County with Noah Monday, authorities launched an urgent search for the boy, saying his parents had failed to bring him to a  medically necessary hospital procedure  the week prior and that he was in need of  lifesaving medical care.  The family was found in Kentucky within hours, and Noah was taken away from his parents; authorities say he is  now being medically treated,  per the Washington Post. His parents are fighting to get him back, with a custody hearing set for Friday. According to his mom, who posts frequently on Facebook about the case, two rounds of chemo were done, Noah was declared cancer-free less than two weeks after he was diagnosed, and the family planned to follow up with alternative treatments, including vitamins and herbs. In a post Tuesday, Bland-Ball said,  His blood results from yesterday showed a healthier boy than ever, which we knew. We took him in for treatment when it was needed and when we asked for an opportunity for a second opinion, we were denied that right to do so.  She added Thursday,  There are so many FDA Approved treatment options that are not chemo that we are open to.  But a doctor tells the Tampa Bay Times research has shown if chemo is stopped early, this type of cancer is likely to return. A Wednesday custody hearing was delayed because the sheriff's office and Guardian ad Litem Program don't want the media there; McAdams and Bland-Ball say they welcome it.

Something more than questionable fashion should stand out, according to new data from the CDC, which finds the average weight of a US woman is now 166.2 pounds—about the same weight as the average man in the 1960s—up from about 140 pounds during that time, reports the Washington Post. That's an increase of 18.5%. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6% gain. Is it as bad as it seems? Essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: Americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35% of Americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69% of adults are either overweight or obese, reports CBS Atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18% between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found Americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of Tonga and Micronesia. The average American was 33 pounds heavier than a Frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than a citizen of Japan, and 70 pounds heavier than a person in Bangladesh, adds the Post. Dying to get back to that 1960s frame? It's actually more important to watch what you eat rather than exercise constantly, though exercising and eating healthy together is obviously beneficial.

Thirty-three-year-old mom Louann Bowers, who gave birth in her cellblock last week, ran away from a nearby Pennsylvania town at age 16, possibly because she had become involved with Sinhue Johnson—the children's father, now in his mid-40s—who was definitely her uncle by marriage. The pair bounced around for years, always on the fringe, before settling in York, where  she was described as 'the crazy lady,'  says her lawyer.  She had her face covered, glasses, always had the walkie-talkie on hand and was almost like the town nut, if you will.  Along the way, Bowers' grandmother died, leaving her more than $100,000—at which point her family had her declared dead after searching for her in vain. That money could be key, notes the Times: Bowers can opt to claim it, and as she's studying for her GED in prison, could try to convince a court that she's fit to reclaim her children from foster care.

The tanker was responsible for transporting fuel to machines used in the wars and had been recognized a number of times for its service. It was traveling to Seattle from Guam in 1957 when it hit a reef. The crew was unharmed, but the ship was lost.

"(Jun 14, 2019  1:44 PM CDT) By last count, six tourists had died under mysterious circumstances in the Dominican Republic over the last year or so, and now there's a seventh and an eighth. NBC News reports 53-year-old Leyla Cox of Staten Island died earlier this week at Punta Cana's Excellence resort. The family of 78-year-old American Jerry Curran also recently revealed that he died at the Dreams hotel there in January. This follows the death of two tourists at the island's Hard Rock resort (one in July 2018, one this past April), the death of a Pennsylvania woman in May at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville, and the deaths of a Maryland couple and a Philly woman at the Grand Bahia Principe la Romana—two in May, one in June. Meanwhile, a Denver couple that vacationed on the island in June 2018 tell Contact7 they also became sick at the Grand Bahia Principe. Back in the US, doctors told them they likely had pesticide poisoning; they now have a $1 million suit against the resort. At least three of the deaths have been tied to pulmonary edemas. Per the New York Post, cops and the FBI are looking into whether tainted alcohol may have played a role in any of the deaths, as some of the victims drank from their hotel mini-bars before falling ill. And, in what seems to be completely unrelated to the recent sicknesses, the family of a Florida surfer who went missing in the Dominican Republic in January 2016 is hoping that the current media attention on the illnesses, as well as on the shooting of ex-Red Sox star David Ortiz, will reinvigorate his case. Darryl Fornatora, then 45, was on vacation there with friend Matthew Rigby, but although Rigby came home, Fornatora didn't—and the family wonders if Rigby knows something.

"(Jan 20, 2015  10:07 AM) The Telegraph calls it  one of the strangest cases of déjà vu ever recorded in medical history : A 23-year-old British man can't lead a normal life because he feels he's  trapped in a time loop,  as he describes it. When his episodes first started in 2007, just after he started university, his déjà vu sometimes lasted just a few minutes at a time. But those episodes got worse, and by 2010, he was no longer able to watch TV, listen to the radio, or read because of persistent feelings of having  encountered the content before.  He also dropped out of school. His case was written up last month in the Journal of Medical Case Reports, and the report notes that unlike many patients (such as those with dementia) who experience chronic déjà vu, this man  is fully aware of the false nature of his  and had no memory problems. He's also not subject to any of the neurological conditions (like temporal lobe epilepsy) typically associated with déjà vu.  Rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar,  says report author Dr. Christine Wells. Wells believes this could be the first-ever case of anxiety causing persistent déjà vu: The man had a history of anxiety, particularly in regards to contamination (he's a frequent hand washer) and that anxiety got worse when he started university. Perhaps anxiety caused  mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety,  Wells tells the Telegraph. However, the report also notes that after the déjà vu started, the man took LSD once,  and from then on the déjà vu was fairly continuous.

"(Feb 17, 2016  7:20 AM) Six weeks after her arrival at Rikers Island, an argument over who should clean a shower sent Candie Hailey to solitary confinement—known as  the bing.  It was the first time, but it would not be the last. Of her first 29 months in jail, Hailey served about 27 alone in a 6-by-10-foot cell, with a bed, toilet, and a few books. And she had yet to be tried for any crime, let alone convicted. Among infractions that sent her to the bing: cursing at an officer and splashing the guard with toilet water (70 days), fighting (40 days), and disrespect of staff (30 days). At least eight times during her more than three-year incarceration, she was hospitalized after suicide attempts in solitary. Hailey had never been diagnosed with mental health issues before Rikers, but jail doctors soon found she had borderline character disorder, mood disorder, and anti-social personality disorder. Hailey's stay at Rikers—detailed in official documents and hours of interviews—is a case study in solitary confinement and its consequences. Many criminal justice experts say officials too often rely on solitary, disregarding the effect on troubled inmates like Hailey. Long-term isolation can induce anxiety, depression, and anger, and studies have found a lack of medical and psychiatric care can make it worse. Hailey finally had her trial last May, with a verdict of not guilty, after spending 2 1/3 years in solitary. Since she was freed, she's been unable to regain custody of her children; fallen out with her family; and struggled to find employment and housing. She's tried to kill herself twice.  I think it all came from solitary confinement,  she says.  I don't think I'll ever be normal again. ...

Now research out of the Andean highlands of South America suggests the humans who braved such conditions more than 7,000 years ago did so in an impressive manner—year-round. As a press release explains, prior research established the presence of hunter-gatherers in the higher elevations of southern Peru as many as 9,000 years ago, but there was much debate over whether their occupation was seasonal or permanent. A team led by University of Wyoming researchers set out to answer the question by excavating a Peruvian site 12,500 feet above sea level. That's more than twice as high as Denver, notes USA Today, and so high that lead researcher Randy Haas says he's seen people faint after deplaning at the regional airport there. The team uncovered the remains of 16 people along with some 80,000 artifacts and then looked at these factors: oxygen and carbon isotopes in the human bones, the demographics of those bones, the travel distance to low-elevation zones, and the makeup of the uncovered tools. The results constitute the  strongest empirical support to date for permanent occupation  there, per the study, published in the Royal Society Open Science: the bones revealed low oxygen and high carbon isotope values,  revealing the distinct signature  of permanent occupation; the travel time to a low-elevation zone was too long to be undertaken seasonally; that women and children were part of the group made a low-elevation migration even unlikelier; and their tools were almost exclusively made with stones found at high-elevations.","At 12K Feet, Humans Did the Unimaginable","At ____K Feet, Humans Did the Unimaginable",12,"SRound( Paraphrase( 12,500 , K ) , 0 )",1

"(Nov 10, 2014  2:00 AM) About 1.6 million people in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia voted yesterday in favor of breaking away from the country in a mock independence poll, but more Catalans avoided voting, either because of the poll's questionable legality or their opposition to secession. Results released early this morning, with 88% of votes counted, showed that more than 2 million people voted in total. But 5.4 million were eligible to vote, meaning many didn't bother to participate in the nonbinding poll. Catalan lawmakers opted for the watered-down poll after plans to hold an official referendum on independence were suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court.  I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,  says one teacher.  Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.  The court then suspended the mock vote on the same grounds Tuesday. But the regional government defied the suspension, manning polling stations with 40,000 volunteers.  Despite the enormous impediments, we have been able to get out the ballot boxes and vote,  Catalan president Artur Mas said after depositing his ballot at a school in Barcelona. Polls in recent years say the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence, while around half support cutting centuries-old ties with Spain. Mas has said the vote was only symbolic. It likely will lead to regional elections that would stand in for a referendum on independence, unless the Spanish government relents.

"(Mar 16, 2017  2:16 PM CDT) Infighting! We got GOP infighting here! Yahoo News reports senators Rand Paul and John McCain are having a bit of a tiff this week after McCain called Paul out on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. McCain was seeking a vote on a Senate bill—expected to be widely supported—in favor of Montenegro's efforts to join NATO. According to Politico, 23 of 28 NATO member nations have already voted in favor of Montenegro joining—but Russia is strenuously opposed to it. McCain claimed anyone who didn't support the bill would be  carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin.  After Paul blocked a vote on the bill and left the Senate, McCain went further, accusing Paul directly of  working for Vladimir Putin.  Paul responded to McCain's comments Thursday, and he didn't pull any punches.  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged,  Paul said, adding that McCain  makes a really, really strong case for term limits.  And he accused McCain of possibly being  past his prime.  Paul justified his opposition to the Montenegro bill by saying that the US military has enough on its plate without possibly having to support the small country, the Hill reports. He also claimed NATO membership isn't supported by a majority of Montenegro citizens. Paul said being called a traitor for opposing the bill might be  a little over the top.  Paul and McCain have clashed on foreign policy before, with Paul accusing McCain of wanting  war everywhere.",Shots Fired in Great McCain-Paul War of 2017,Shots Fired in Great McCain-Paul War of ____,2017,Copy( 2017 ),0

Militants lobbed grenades and fired automatic weapons to push back the raid in a two-story building in Qalqiliya, a West Bank town with a strong Hamas presence. When it was over, pools of blood, tear gas canisters, and hundreds of spent shell casings littered the floor. Walls were partly burned down during the battle. Qalqiliya, which elected a Hamas mayor in 2005, was tense today.

"(Jun 15, 2016  6:01 PM CDT) The state of Louisiana's refusal to install air conditioning on death row has already cost taxpayers at least $1,067,000 in expenses fighting a lawsuit filed on behalf of three inmates with medical problems, according to records obtained by the AP. Meanwhile the state could spend roughly the same money—and possibly much less—on an AC system that would satisfy a federal judge's order to protect death row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. This tally, based on state documents provided in response to the AP's public records requests, is the first public accounting of how much the case has cost taxpayers. Most of the money has gone to private attorneys on opposing sides of the case, which US District Judge Brian Jackson says could ultimately cost many more millions of dollars, and expert witnesses and state contractors also have received tens of thousands of dollars. More than two years have passed since Jackson ruled Louisiana imposes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment once the heat index exceeds 88 degrees. The index routinely crosses that threshold on death row, occasionally exceeding 100 degrees; plaintiff James Magee said it's like a  sauna  in the morning and an  oven  in the afternoon. A plaintiffs' expert estimated it would cost about $225,000—sans engineering fees or operating costs—to install AC on death row's six tiers. A state engineer in 2014 said nine AC units could cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that holds death row, with a state attorney saying each unit would cost  several thousand dollars.  State attorneys argue installing AC would spawn more suits from prisoners nationwide demanding cooler cells. Jackson is set to hear testimony Wednesday on whether the state's current heat remediation measures—one cold shower a day, ice chests in the cells, and fans outside—are adequately protecting the plaintiffs as Louisiana's sweltering summer approaches.",La.

With the blessing of Brazil's government, some 1,000 espionage experts—about 350 of them onsite in Rio—are positioned and ready to protect the Olympics and its spectators. Although there's no known (or disclosed) plot against the sports competition, all 17 US intelligence agencies have taken on the task, in conjunction with their Brazilian counterparts, to  identify and disrupt potential threats,  says a spokesman for National Intelligence Director James Clapper. The US force is said to include analysts and members of law enforcement, as well as more than a dozen special-ops commandos from the Navy and Marine Corps.

On Wednesday, 14 of the women—mostly aged 18 to 22, the AP notes—were sentenced to 11 years following their participation in a pro-Mohamed Morsi demonstration. Seven girls, meanwhile, were sentenced to juvenile detention until they turn 18. Charges included illegal gathering, weapons possession, and thuggery; rights groups called the ruling  politicized.

This means that any lawyer who comes close to the case will be detained.

He demonstrated against him on June 30, but he's been involved in defending freedoms since July 3 ... He's being punished for that.

One breakfast cooked up at the Bear Grills cafe in Congleton, England, is so daunting that only 20 people have tried it—and no one has successfully cleaned their plate. The chef tells the Daily Mail it's called  the Hibernator  because  if anyone completes it they'll have to sleep for a year.  The 7-pound, 8,000-calorie meal is served on a 4-foot turkey platter and includes four fried eggs, a four-egg cheese omelet, eight sausages, eight strips of bacon, four hash browns, four waffles, four pieces of toast, four pieces of fried bread, four servings of black pudding (blood sausage), two scoops of beans, two of tomatoes, mushrooms, large fries, and a 2-pint milkshake.

The staggering figure from a first-ever Justice Department study highlights the need to strengthen laws and enforcement, especially with technology now making it easier for stalkers to terrorize victims and disrupt their lives. In Illinois, for example, where a 43-year-old was gunned down by a stalker last year, laws make prosecution difficult; protection orders are issued only if the accused is a former partner or household member. While stalking precedes many intimate killings, about two-thirds of stalkers were never romantically involved with their victims.

This morning brings the news that the Democrat plans to announce his presidential intentions on May 30. The former Maryland governor will do so in Baltimore, and staging the announcement there could carry risk. O'Malley's record as Baltimore's mayor a decade ago has faced scrutiny since rioting broke out in the city following the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in police custody. O'Malley has defended his work to curb violent crime in the city and signaled it would play a leading role in his campaign if he enters the presidential race. O'Malley remains largely unknown on the national scene but has offered glimpses of what his campaign agenda might look like, emphasizing that he would focus heavily on economic inequality, campaign finance reform, and a foreign policy focused on national security threats and creating new global alliances. In a field dominated by Hillary Clinton, the 52-year-old O'Malley has sought to present himself as a fresh face representing a new generation of leadership.

Family spokesman Jim McGrath says Bush died shortly after 10pm Friday, about eight months after the death of his wife, Barbara Bush. The nation's 41st president served from 1989 to 1993, and eight years later watched his son George W. became the 43rd president. The elder Bush saw his popularity swell with the United States' success in the Gulf War in 1991, only to watch it evaporate in a brief but deep recession. The Republican was defeated in his bid for a second term by Democrat Bill Clinton. Bush had also been a World War II hero, Texas congressman, CIA director, and Ronald Reagan's vice president.

"(Sep 15, 2015  12:00 PM CDT) Bernie Sanders' populist message has him surging in the polls, but his vision comes at a price: $18 trillion over a decade, to be specific, according to the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper crunched the numbers on his various proposals to arrive at that eye-popping total, one that would amount to the  largest peacetime expansion of government in modern American history,  writes reporter Laura Meckler. The biggest chunk of the total, about $15 trillion, is associated with Sanders' plan to expand Medicare to all Americans. Other big-ticket items include $1 trillion in spending on roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects, and $750 billion for tuition-free public colleges. (Update: A Washington Post analysis of the Journal story makes the case that the $18 trillion figure is grossly misleading. For one thing, that $15 trillion estimate for health care reform is based not on Sanders' figures but on the cost of a similar bill currently in Congress. Still, the Journal finds that it's not just conservatives wary of Sanders' initiatives.  We are not a country that has limitless resources,  says Jim Kessler of the Democratic think tank Third Way.  You need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn’t.  To help pay for it, Sanders has so far pitched tax increases, mostly on the wealthy, that would bring in $6.5 trillion over a decade. More tax proposals on the way. His  agenda does cost money,  acknowledges Sanders' policy director. But  if you look at the problems that are out there, it’s very reasonable.  Along those lines, the Post adds that  while Sanders does want to spend significant amounts of money, almost all of it is on things we’re already paying for; he just wants to change how we pay for them.  A blogger at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has a different mindset, writing that despite all the attention paid to Donald Trump, the Journal story shows that Sanders is  the most radical candidate  in the race.",WSJ: Cost of Bernie Sanders' Agenda: $18T,WSJ: Cost of Bernie Sanders' Agenda: $____T,18,Copy( 18 ),0

Tiny Tim's Toy Foundation, founded more than a decade ago in Utah, produces and distributes small wooden cars to children in need around the world. Some of those kids are sick in hospitals, others are living in a tough neighborhood, still others are impoverished in a developing country, but they all react similarly when given the wooden toys:  Kids will drop to the floor and start ‘driving’ them on the concrete, the tile, the dirt,  a retired teacher who drives 60 miles round-trip once a week to volunteer at the factory tells the Washington Post.  The response of pure joy is always the same.  Thacker and his wife, both 83, came up with the idea for the foundation when he and his wife used to dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus and distribute toys to kids in Mexico. The wood is donated and the factory's rent is paid by a benefactor. In addition to volunteers—mostly retirees, with an average age of 80—Thacker and his wife get help producing the cars from groups like churches, Boy Scout troops, and civic organizations. Most of the cars are painted by inmates at a Utah correctional facility, and the volunteer who spoke to the Post says many of them are moved to the point of tears by the chance to help others. The toys are then distributed by charities, churches, children's hospitals, and even long-haul truckers who stop by the factory to pick up a box, dropping off its contents along their routes. Thacker tells the Post he and his wife  both knew the important role toys played in helping little minds to grow. ...

"(Feb 4, 2016  8:13 AM) A US National Academy of Medicine committee said Wednesday the FDA should approve clinical trials for three-parent fertilization in human embryos—with some caveats, Nature reports. In its report, the committee recommended such trials be limited to women at risk of passing along  serious mitochondrial disease  to their kids, and it wants the mitochondrial replacement techniques, or MRT, limited to male embryos only initially. That's because mitochondria is inherited from the mother, and such a restriction would confine the modified mitochondria to one generation.  We concluded that the most germane issues could be avoided if the use of these techniques were restricted by certain conditions, rather than prohibiting them altogether,  committee chair Jeffrey Kahn says in a press release. How the process would work: We have two types of DNA—nuclear DNA, which passes on genetic traits, and mitochondrial DNA. During MRT, a woman with mitochondrial DNA disease would have her nuclear DNA transferred to the nuclear DNA-free eggs of a woman whose mitochondrial DNA is just fine. This would result in three parents, with nuclear DNA from one man and one woman and mitochondrial DNA from another woman. But despite the committee's recommendation, there's still one major hitch: The federal 2016 spending bill currently in effect prohibits the FDA from greenlighting the implantation of modified embryos into women.  The future seems very hazy compared to a few months ago,  a reproductive-biology specialist who's been pushing for such trials tells Nature.",US Panel: OK to Make 3-Parent Embryos —Male Ones,US Panel: OK to Make ____-Parent Embryos —Male Ones,3,Trans( three ),1
"(Mar 16, 2016  7:52 AM CDT) A new study on the Zika virus may or may not allay pregnant women's fears: Researchers in French Polynesia have strengthened the link between Zika and microcephaly, though they say just one in 100 pregnant women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy developed a fetus with an abnormally small brain or head. The rate—based on an outbreak from October 2013 to April 2014 during which 66% of the population was infected— means you have a 99% chance of having a normal baby,  an expert says, per the New York Times. That's remarkable considering a child born to a woman with rubella in early pregnancy has a 50% risk of birth defects, per the Guardian. However, researchers caution that the rate of microcephaly tied to Zika may vary greatly depending on the outbreak and location. Researchers identified eight babies born with microcephaly from September 2013 to July 2015. Previously, about two cases per 10,000 newborns was the norm. Though the mothers weren't tested for Zika, seven cases were discovered around the end of the outbreak between March and July 2014 and  such temporal clustering strongly supports the proposed association  between Zika and microcephaly, researchers say.  It's still a large public health problem,  a researcher notes.  Severely small heads is only 'the tip of the iceberg,' as many other birth defects are now studied as potentially correlated with Zika's infection, too, increasing the burden of disability and devastation that these babies could be facing, if they survive,  a doctor adds, per Live Science.

Hernandez took all the photos of Steven, even an ultrasound image, that could be used to identify him; Mancia had to contact family in El Salvador to get the sole picture of her son she's treasured all the years since.

Jean-Claude Romand of France, whose double life inspired two French films, was released Thursday following an April decision to grant him parole, per AFP. Romand did indeed enroll in medical school in the 1970s but repeated the first-year program for 12 successive years while lying to friends and family, per the BBC. He said he had become a doctor and secured a job with the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. To make his ruse seem legit, Romand drove daily to the border area between France and Switzerland. He would also claim to go on foreign trips, then hide out at highway rest stops. He lived on money from the sale of his student flat, bought for him by his parents, then sought money from loved ones, who believed he had access to investment opportunities as a UN employee. The scheme began to unravel in 1992 as creditors closed in and a family friend checked a WHO staff list. Romand then killed wife Florence with a rolling pin and shot his two children—a daughter, 7, and son, 5—with a rifle on January 9, 1993. The 38-year-old then drove 50 miles to kill his parents and their dog before returning home, downing sleeping pills and starting a fire. He was rescued and convicted of murder in 1996.

"(Feb 16, 2015  2:29 PM) A hacking ring has allegedly stolen up to $1 billion from banks around the world in what appears to be one of the biggest banking breaches known; the Telegraph calls it the  world's biggest bank raid.  The hackers have been active since at least the end of 2013 and infiltrated more than 100 banks in 30 countries, according to Russian security company Kaspersky Lab. After gaining access to banks' computers through phishing schemes and other methods, they lurk for months to learn the banks' systems, taking screen shots and even video of employees using their computers, the company says. Once the hackers become familiar with the banks' operations, they apparently use that knowledge to steal money without raising suspicions. In so doing, they program ATMs to dispense money at specific times or set up fake accounts and transfer money into them. The hackers seem to limit their theft to about $10 million before moving on to another bank, part of the reason why the fraud was not detected earlier, says Kaspersky. The attacks are unusual because they target the banks themselves rather than customers and their account information. Most of the targets have been in Russia, the US, Germany, China, and Ukraine, although the attackers may be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, Kaspersky says. In one case, a bank lost $7.3 million through ATM fraud. In another case, a financial institution lost $10 million by the attackers exploiting its online banking platform.

Anthony Sanborn, 44, had been convicted of killing 16-year-old Jessica Briggs and sentenced to 70 years in prison. At a hearing earlier Thursday, Hope Cady testified that as a troubled 13-year-old she was pressured by police and prosecutors into identifying Sanborn, who was 16 at the time, as the killer.

Made by British label Huntley & Palmers, the fruitcake was hidden inside a  severely corroded  tin taken from the hut as part of a conservation project encompassing several old huts built during a Norwegian expedition in 1899, per AAP.

Unfortunately, it didn't smell quite as good, with an odor of  rancid butter,  Lizzie Meek of New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust tells Newshub. The fruitcake was actually one of 1,500 artifacts recovered from the huts. And it wasn't the only food item.

A lab test revealed the deadly amoeba, which can be tough to spot, and doctors immediately reached out to the maker of a drug recently approved to treat the parasite—the company, Profounda, happens to be based in Orlando. After Profounda got the call, notes the Sentinel,  the drug to treat Sebastian was delivered in 12 minutes.  Miltefosine isn't commonly stocked by hospitals, which cost the life of an 11-year-old Florida boy in 2014, but that may change after Sebastian’s close call. Quick treatment was credited with saving a 12-year-old in Arkansas in 2014. Only three people out of 138 have survived infection, according to the CDC. For the DeLeon family at least, there is a happy ending.  We are so thankful that God has given us the miracle,  said the teen’s mother, Brunilda Gonzalez.

"(Apr 14, 2009  8:27 AM CDT) Retail sales fell unexpectedly in March, delivering a setback to hopes that the economy's steep slide could be bottoming out. The Commerce Department cited a 1.1% drop, the biggest decline in 3 months and a much weaker showing than the 0.3% increase that analysts expected. Falling auto sales led the overall slump in demand. Sales also plunged at clothing stores, appliance outlets, and furniture stores. Meanwhile, wholesale prices dropped sharply last month as the cost of gasoline and other energy plummeted, fresh evidence that inflation appears to pose little threat to the economy. The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, fell by 1.2% in March; analysts expected no change.

While the well still needs to be permanently sealed with cement and inspected by state regulators, the announcement by Southern California Gas Co. marked the first time the leak has been under control since it was reported Oct. 23.  We have temporarily controlled the natural gas flow from the leaking well and begun the process of sealing the well and permanently stopping the leak,  Jimmie Cho, a SoCalGas senior vice president, said in a statement.

Public health officials blamed their woes on an odorant added to gas so it can be detected and have said they don't expect long-term health impacts. Some folks have said they don't want to move back, and many are concerned about what the incident has done to the value of their homes.

President Obama is up six percentage points over Mitt Romney in the latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, a small increase from last month when he had a three-point lead. In 12 battleground states, Obama's lead is eight points, the same as last month.  So much has happened, and so little has changed,  said a Democratic pollster. One thing both candidates have in common is that their very negative numbers are both rising. In fact, people say the more they learn about both candidates, the more they don't like either one of them. Obama's favorable/unfavorable ratings are now 49%-43%, down a bit from June's 47%-38%; while Romney's are 35%-40%, a tick better than last month's 33%-39%.

Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith says Rogelio Chavez was taken into custody at the house of an associate in San Jose, the AP reports. Video of the scene showed a man in handcuffs being led out of the house by at least six officers. Detectives were trying to search the home of Karla Fernandez when they noticed someone was hiding in the attic and requested backup from the SWAT team, Smith said. A SWAT team shot tear gas canisters into the home at least twice during the standoff. Authorities say Chavez was taken to a hospital because he was suspected of being under the influence of crack cocaine and marijuana. Fernandez, who's on probation, was also arrested and is facing charges of resisting and obstructing an investigation, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and being an accessory to an escaped inmate.

She had been standing with other civilians near police vehicles, and authorities suspect the shooter was firing at police. Earlier, they released video of the alleged masked gunman. The unrest in Londonderry revolves around the decades-long unrest in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, and the latest escalation is being linked to tensions over Brexit, reports CNN. The coming of Brexit raises the possibility that hard borders will once again be put in place between Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK, and the rest of Ireland, which is in the European Union.

The triplets, born in October 2016, underwent a set of surgeries at just two months of age in January and are all thriving back at home, apparently not even minding their helmets, which they must wear 23 hours a day for the next six to nine months.  Your skull is made up of plates, it’s not a single bone,  says operating surgeon David Chesler of Stony Brook Children's Hospital. If the plates fuse too early, it can  detrimental to the brain, the vision, the life of the child. It’s not imminently life-threatening, but it can cause real consequences down the road.  It occurs just once in every 2,000 births, but doctors put the odds of it occurring in triplets—particularly a set that isn't identical and thus not prone to the exact same malformations—at one in 500 trillion, reports CBS Local. Mom Amy calls their progress  amazing  and their father, Mike, says that while life with three boys and three cats is  crazy,  he  wouldn't change it for the world.  They say they'd love to have a girl, but aren't planning to try.  With our luck, we would have another set of triplets,  Mike says.

Well, the two Hitachi elevators will cover 95 floors in 43 seconds, Businessweek reports. They'll be housed in the 1,738-foot Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, which is due to open in 2016. According to Hitachi, passengers will have a  comfortable ride.  But  when you're traveling that distance, you're going to get pressures on your ears changing,  an expert tells the BBC. Hitachi says it will adjust air pressure inside the elevator cars accordingly. Meanwhile,  active guide rollers  will deal with vibration and any  minute warping in the guide rails,  the company adds. Brakes will be able to withstand high temperatures. Currently, the world's fastest elevators are in Taiwan's Taipei 101 building; they move at 37.7mph.

The angry 43-page complaint claims that Gore and Hyatt wooed him with promises that he would be his own boss. But then Hyatt began running Olbermann's program as his  personal hobbyhorse,  and  major business errors became commonplace and acceptable,  according to the suit. Two weeks before Countdown began, says the suit, Hyatt threatened to shut it down unless Olbermann reined in his representatives after Hyatt accused Olbermann's manager of leaking contract details to the Hollywood Reporter—triggering claims in the lawsuit that the threat amounted to  blackmail.  Olbermann  deeply regrets his decision to put his trust in Hyatt and Gore,  the suit states. The suit also says Current TV scheduled program guest hosts without Olbermann's approval, and released inaccurate data understating the program's ratings, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Berkshire has been a significant P&G shareholder since the consumer products firm acquired Gillette in 2005, but the Duracell acquisition will use nearly all of Berkshire's 52.48 million shares; Buffett has estimated that Berkshire's P&G stake cost it roughly $336 million.  I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,  Buffett said in a statement today. Berkshire already owns a number of well-known consumer brands in its portfolio of more than 80 businesses, including Fruit of the Loom, Geico, Helzberg Diamonds, and half of the HJ Heinz Co. P&G, the world's biggest consumer products maker—its products include Tide and Pampers—has been trimming its product lineup to focus on its top performers. After it finishes jettisoning more than half its brands around the globe over the next year or two, P&G has said it will retain 70 to 80 brands. The company had announced last month that it wanted to make Duracell, which it acquired in 2005, a stand-alone company. P&G will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by Berkshire Hathaway (those shares are currently valued at about $4.7 billion).

In some cases, one officer allegedly reported another as a witness—when the second cop was elsewhere writing up a ticket of his own, KHOU reported last month. Why would they do this?

Police say the boy stabbed his sister to death and seriously injured his 56-year-old mother in the Monday afternoon incident. No motive has been given. West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor says the town is  incredibly brokenhearted,  the Hartford Courant reports.  As mayor this is just the worst nightmare,  she says.  To have a tragedy like this and to lose anybody in your community is very difficult.  The mother has been identified as Janemarie Murphy, a lobbyist well-known and well-liked at the state Capitol. ABC reports that both children were honor students at Sedgwick Middle School. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who knows Murphy, offered his condolences to the family and the town after what he called an  unbelievably heart-wrenching and unthinkable tragedy.  The girl has been identified as 12-year-old Brigid Curtin. Her brother, who was injured in the incident and remains hospitalized, faces charges of murder with special circumstances and first-degree assault. His mother is in stable condition in a different hospital. Criminal defense attorney Walter Hussey says there is no chance of the boy being tried as an adult, WFSB reports.

Police say the man was moving equipment on the roof of a bank building in San Francisco's financial district and not on a window-washing platform when he fell Friday morning, crashing against the roof and back window of a sedan. So how did he possibly survive the impact? Physics professor Paul Doherty explains that it took about three seconds for the man, falling at an estimated speed of 60mph, to hit the car, which acted as a big shock absorber.  He crushed the roof in a part where there were no reinforcement pillars and that allowed the roof to collapse more than a foot, maybe even two feet, under him and spread out the impact,  says Doherty.

"(Apr 1, 2020  7:21 AM CDT) Though it may seem the US missed its chance to get ahead of the coronavirus, one prominent name sees glimmers of hope. In a Washington Post op-ed, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates notes that  the choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down, and how many Americans will have to bury a loved one.  First, Gates points out, there's no current consistent approach for getting people to stay home.  The country's leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere,  he writes, adding  any confusion about this point will only extend the economic pain, raise the odds that the virus will return, and cause more deaths.  Second, Gates notes, our testing efforts—both in number of tests available and in how they're administered—need improvement. Self-test swabs that don't expose health care workers, as well as better prioritization on who gets the tests, are just two areas Gates is pushing for. The third bullet point, per Gates:  a data-based approach to developing treatments and a vaccine.  He notes that although scientists are working as fast as they can to develop both,  leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic buying.  Gates says we may very well be able to achieve a vaccine in less than 18 months, but in combination with that, we have to ensure we have enough doses for everyone, and enough facilities to manufacture them. In short, though things look dire and  we still have a long way to go ... I still believe that if we make the right decisions now, informed by science, data, and the experience of medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to work,  Gates writes.

"(Sep 1, 2014  9:39 AM CDT) Gun control advocates may have been thrilled with US sanctions on Russia that banned imports of AK-47s, but they probably didn't count on the huge jump in US sales of the assault rifle that resulted. Gun dealers have run out of inventory after consumers rushed to stockpile Kalashnikov AK-47s when the Obama administration made its sanctions announcement in July, according to the Washington Post. As Fox Business noted in July, the ban doesn't prohibit people who already own a Kalashnikov gun from keeping it or reselling it, according to the Treasury's sanctions FAQ; rather, it's meant to  exacerbate Russia’s economic problems  after its actions in Ukraine. Kalashnikov Concern is banned from importing any of its guns, including the more advanced AK-74, CNN reported in July. While the import stoppage may be hurting Moscow, it has only lit a fire under gun advocates—some have bought up to 10 rifles each as an  investment,  notes the Post—who think the Ukraine crisis is just an excuse for increased gun control. While sales booms such as this are great for firearms dealers, one tells the Post that in the long run, similar bans  might put us out of business.  Another concurs:  A two- or three-month jump in sales, only to have the rest of your lifetime to not have those sales, is kind of stupid,  he says.

The Post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against Kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him (two of whom have never spoken out publicly before); BuzzFeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with Kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly  brainwashed  by Kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call  Daddy.  They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups.

The sale of 140,000 straws—10 of them for $15, with  Trump  stamped on them—totaled more than $200,000, his campaign manager tweeted Monday. Saying that paper straws don't work, the online offering calls for shoppers to stand with the president and  buy your pack of recyclable straws today.  The Made-in-America straws are recyclable, the Washington Examiner reports. Brad Parscale's tweet Monday said that more than half of buyers were small donors new to Trump's campaign.

South Korean reports have quoted Choi Sung-ryong as saying three detained Americans have been shifted from labor camps to a hotel near Pyongyang in what appears to be preparation for their release, reports Reuters. North Korea and the US  seem to have decided on a date to release these people,  according to Choi, who said they were moved weeks ago. The State Department said it  cannot confirm the validity of these reports,  but they are working to see detained Americans  come home as soon as possible.   As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!  Trump tweeted Wednesday. The three detained Americans are Kim Dong Chul, a pastor who was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor in 2016; Tony Kim, a Pyongyang University of Science and Technology professor detained as he tried to fly out of Pyongyang a year ago; and Kim Hak Song, a fellow professor arrested a week after Tony Kim was detained.

"(Oct 7, 2015  1:32 PM CDT) Apple has skipped out on paying close to $60 billion in taxes on $181 billion it holds offshore, according to a new study. But though the company holds the most profits offshore of any US company, it's hardly alone: At least 358 American companies hold $2.1 trillion in profits, which would be subject to a 35% corporate tax rate if the funds were to reach the US, according to the review by two left-leaning nonprofits, per Reuters. That means $620 billion could be collected by feds—enough money to eliminate the federal deficit, notes CNBC. Instead, companies move assets to places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where they pay about 6% in taxes. The report finds 60% of companies with tax subsidiaries had at least one in either country, though the Netherlands had the highest number of subsidiaries. Think $620 billion in potential tax gains is high? The actual number is likely much higher. The report notes just 57 companies disclosed how much they would owe if they transferred their offshore holdings back home. As  nearly 72% of the Fortune 500 operate subsidiaries in tax haven jurisdictions as of the end of 2014 … Congress can and should take strong action to prevent corporations from using offshore tax havens, which in turn would restore basic fairness to the tax system, reduce the deficit, and improve the functioning of markets,  the study from Citizens for Tax Justice and the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund found. Just 30 companies account for $1.4 trillion in offshore profits. General Electric was found to hold $119 billion in 18 tax havens, Microsoft has $108.3 billion in five, and Pfizer has $74 billion in 151.",There's $620B in Taxes the US Can't Get Its Hands On,There's $____B in Taxes the US Can't Get Its Hands On,620,Copy( 620 ),0

Two decades ago, Milanian went for a jog in the foothills of Altadena, Calif., with her dogs when one of the dogs started scratching at the dirt. Milanian walked over to the dog and saw something that took her breath away: two tiny feet sticking out from a shallow grave. Milanian started to dig and found a 7-pound, 12-ounce newborn wrapped in a blanket, his umbilical cord still attached, barely clinging to life. His body temperature was 80º. She cleared the dirt from his mouth and nose and begged him not to die.  He grabbed my wrist and stopped crying,  Milanian told the LA Times in 1998. Milanian called 911 and flagged down a motorist who got help from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The baby was nursed back to health at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and was eventually adopted. Unbeknownst to Milanian, the baby grew into a strapping young man named Matthew Whitaker. Over the years, Milanian has been haunted by the memory of finding the baby and tried repeatedly to locate him. No luck. But years later, a producer for On Air with Ryan Seacrest heard Whitaker’s story, did some detective work, and reunited them 20 years to the day of the rescue. When Milanian saw Whitaker, she burst into tears as he hugged her. That day, Milanian drove Whitaker to the hiking trail where she found him.

Robert West got suspicious when he went to the dentist and was told his Medicaid benefits had maxed out. He went home, combed through his records, and realized that Maxim Healthcare had billed the government for hundreds of hours of nursing care he never received.

It's a staggering number, if you think about it,  says the lead author.  Basically there's one of these planets per star.  The researchers figured the estimate by studying Kepler-32, a five-planet system that, they say, is representative of many such systems in the galaxy, Space.com reports. The planets orbit around the most common type of star in the galaxy, and they are similar in size and orbit pattern to other planets spotted orbiting around the same type of star.  This is as close to a Rosetta stone as anything I've seen,  says a co-author.  It's like unlocking a language that we're trying to understand—the language of planet formation.

"(Sep 7, 2015  6:32 AM CDT) An already critically endangered species has been driven even further to the brink after an insane population decline compounded by the fact that scientists are at a loss to explain it. Initially, scientists weren’t too perturbed to hear some saigas—a type of antelope that inhabits Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia—were dying off during their calving period in May; some 12,000 died of apparent digestive issues last year after scientists speculated that there was too much greenery, reports Live Science. But suddenly, at least 120,000 animals, or half of Kazakhstan’s population, were dead by June, including a herd of 60,000 saigas felled in four days.  I have worked in veterinary diseases all my career and I have never seen 100% mortality,  an expert tells Nature.  That is extraordinary.  Another adds the  extent  and  speed  of the die-off  has not been observed for any other species...It's really unheard of.  Researchers quickly moved to identify the threat, following what little clues they had: Necropsies and observations showed mothers died first, followed by their calves. But a most mysterious find came next: Scientists found toxins from the usually-harmless Pasteurella and possibly Clostridia bacteria often found in the animals’ bodies were causing extensive bleeding in their organs, per UPI. What had changed in the bacteria to make it suddenly deadly? Apparently, nothing.  There is nothing so special about it. The question is why it developed so rapidly and spread to all the animals,  a researcher says. Experts are continuing to investigate but say the die-off may be another  flash crash  like the 1988 die-off of 400,000 saigas; bacteria may have spread more easily this year via standing water after a wet spring; or the Pasteurella and Clostridia bacteria may have suddenly sprung into unexpected action.

"(Nov 24, 2015  11:36 AM) A newly approved drug is being hailed as a major advance in treatment of cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic disease that clogs the lungs with mucus and makes patients struggle to breathe. But it comes with a punishing price tag—about $710 per patient per day. Orkambi—taken as two pills, twice daily—is a combination of two cystic fibrosis drugs that won approval from the FDA in July. Federal law requires Medicaid to cover FDA-approved drugs, and the US government picks up more than half the tab. The treatment takes a bite out of Medicaid programs already facing big budget problems, and a small state like Vermont will be on the hook next year for $3.6 million—nearly 7% of the state's estimated $54 million Medicaid budget deficit—for a drug expected to treat only 40 people. Orkambi's arrival follows on the heels of last year's new hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, which claimed the record for the most expensive drug purchase by Vermont Medicaid. About 70 Medicaid patients received it in Vermont last fiscal year, leaving the state with a bill of nearly $5.9 million, says a Department of Vermont Health Access rep.  States that have small budgets in their Medicaid also can't afford ... to pay for 40 people in their state when they've got many others who need diabetes drugs and whatever other drugs,  says a drug pricing expert.

After some prodding, doctors discovered the man had suppressed a sneeze by pinching his nose and clamping his mouth shut. That ended up rupturing his throat from the force of the stifled sneeze, rendering him voiceless and landing him in the hospital. Anthony Aymat, a London doctor not involved in the study, explains to the AP that sneezes can escape your body at 150mph or so, and that if you try to keep one inside,  it could do a lot of damage and you could end up like the Michelin Man with air trapped in your body.  Although they say a throat rupture like this is rare, the study's researchers elaborate on other potential complications, including a brain aneurysm or eardrum damage, per the Guardian. The University of Texas' Dr. Zi Yang Jiang, who says he sees a couple of sneeze-induced issues each year, tells the AP a collapsed lung is also possible. Doctors used scans to assess this patient and found the popping sound was caused by air bubbles that had formed in his throat tissue and neck.  The whole point of sneezing is to get something out of your body, like viruses and bacteria ... if you stop that, those may end up in the wrong part of the body,  Jiang says. The patient was given antibiotics, fed through a tube, and released a week later, with strict instructions to let future sneezes fly.  The safest thing to do—although it's not socially acceptable—is just to sneeze loud,  Aymat tells the AP.

The Atlantic notes we already knew that this occurred, but that the toll is just now being fully understood: It describes a new study published in the journal Nature as  a kind of autopsy report for the debacle.  A team led by Terry Hughes, the head of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, examined the  catastrophic die-off  more closely to establish links between high levels of heat exposure, the resulting coral bleaching, and how well the coral ultimately withstood it. The upshot isn't good: About a third of the world's largest reef system succumbed to the  mass mortality  between March and November that year, per the Guardian. The Los Angeles Times notes a second heat wave in 2017 exacerbated things, with both events leading to the destruction of about half the Great Barrier Reef's coral. The researchers found that coral in areas where the heat exposure was greatest experienced the biggest die-offs. (Per the New York Times, it only takes a spike of two or three degrees Fahrenheit above normal to decimate the coral.) Another shocker: About half the coral destroyed in 2016 didn't gradually die from starvation, as scientists believed would happen, but instead went south  very quickly  from heat stress, taking only a few weeks to perish. Hughes says he's trying to keep a  glass half full  outlook, noting that the billion corals that did endure are more resilient than their unfortunate counterparts.

The new loos will offer security features designed to hinder violence, vandalism, sleeping, and anything two people might do together (more than one media outlet calls them  anti-sex toilets ). For example, weight sensors will ensure only one person at a time, and sound alarms/water spray will go off if violent movement is detected.

The $1 option undercuts even the cheapest offerings of thrifty coffee vendors like Dunkin’ Donuts.

"(Dec 18, 2018  12:48 AM) President Trump has authorized the Agriculture Department to launch the second and final round of $11 billion in trade mitigation payments to farmers hard hit by tariffs. In a tweet on Monday, Trump said he is fulfilling a promise to protect farmers against  unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations.   Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers!  the president said. The Trump administration in July announced it would provide up to $12 billion to offset losses from Trump's trade disputes with China and other countries. The first round of checks went out in September. In total, producers of almonds, corn, cotton, dairy, hogs, sorghum, soybeans, fresh sweet cherries, and wheat will receive roughly $9.5 billion, the AP reports. Soybean farmers will get the largest share. China resumed buying American soybeans last week, although exports to the country are still down an estimated 97% for the year, CNN reports. Roughly $1.2 billion is earmarked for a food purchase and distribution program and $200 million to promote trade.  This assistance will help with short-term cash flow issues as we move into the new year,  Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement Monday.

"(Jun 19, 2012  8:35 AM CDT) Last year, environmental activists were killed at the rate of one per week—a rate that has nearly doubled in just three years. The shocking statistic comes from a Global Witness report, released on the eve of the Rio+20 sustainable development conference in Brazil—one of the most dangerous countries for environmental activists, with nearly half of the worldwide killings reported there. The report calls on the conference leaders to monitor and fight back against the increasing violence, the Guardian reports. The deaths involve community leaders, journalists, and campaigners who work to protect forests, rivers, and land, and many cases involved governments and foreign corporations or competition over resources including gas and oil.  This trend points to the increasingly fierce global battle for resources, and represents the sharpest of wake-up calls for delegates in Rio,  says a Global Witness rep. The group says the true death toll is probably higher than reported, since the results are incomplete.","On Average, 1 Eco-Activist Killed Every Week","On Average, ____ Eco-Activist Killed Every Week",1,Trans( one ),1

Organizers are calling it the largest such strike to date. The workers plan to picket the likes of McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC during lunchtime as they call for wages of $15 an hour and the right to form a union without fear of retaliation, the AP reports. The previous  biggest strike  occurred in July, when as many as 2,220 workers participated in a seven-city strike. The fast-food workers will be joined by a number of allies, including employees from Walmart, Macy's, Sears, Dollar Tree, warehouses, and car washes, organizers say. The event roughly coincides with the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, reports USA Today, and at a march ceremony yesterday, Obama said that,  For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar,  though he is advocating $9 an hour minimum.

On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to Gomez and Nancy Pelosi questioning why Gomez hadn't been sworn in yet.  They have no representative to debate and vote in the People’s House on the critical issues facing our country,  the letter said of Gomez's constituents. McCarthy was even more blunt on Wednesday, saying Gomez is  neglecting his job  and should maybe resign to let his constituents elect someone who actually wants to do the work. The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus accused McCarthy of making  an unfounded attack on [Gomez's] character.  Gomez has offered multiple reasons for holding off on his swearing in, the Los Angeles Times reports. First, he said he wanted to wait until his election was certified. But he's also currently a California state assemblyman and was trying to put off giving up that position as long as possible to vote on extending a cap-and-trade program. Gomez says he only agreed to stay for the vote until June 15 but a family issue prevented him from being sworn in last week. The Fourth of July holiday will mean further delays. A senior Democratic aide tells Politico Gomez will finally be sworn in July 11. Two representatives elected after Gomez have already been sworn in.

Mayweather figured out a 50th opponent Saturday night, letting McGregor have the early rounds before stalking him late and leaving the mixed martial artist defenseless and exhausted on the ropes in the 10th round. It was a smashing end to a career that earned Mayweather more money than any fighter before him—including an estimated $200 million for his last bout, reports the AP.  I think we gave the fans what they wanted to see,  Mayweather said.  I owed them for the (Manny) Pacquiao fight.  Mayweather battered McGregor around the ring in the later rounds, finally stopping him at 1:05 of the 10th with a flurry of punches that forced referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight. Mayweather methodically broke McGregor down after a slow start to score his first real stoppage in nearly a decade. In a fight so intriguing that it cost $10,000 for ringside seats, McGregor turned in a respectable performance for his first fight, but Mayweather's experience and ring savvy paid off.  I was a little fatigued,  he said.  He was composed in there, that's what 50 pro fights can give you.  McGregor's challenge of Mayweather was fueled by social media and turned into a spectacle as the two fighters promoted the bout.

But even 10 inches of snow falling in a single hour is unprecedented there. Well, it was until Wednesday. In Thompson Pass, a gap in the Chugach Mountains northeast of town, a record 10 inches of snow fell in 60 minutes, followed by another 5 inches in 30 minutes.

"(Jul 31, 2018  11:47 AM CDT) Keith King says no amount of money could make up for his busted marriage. Nonetheless, a North Carolina judge has ordered his wife's lover to pay him $8.8 million. The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called  alienation of affection,  reports WSOC. In this case, the 48-year-old King claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old Danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports WRAL and Inside Edition.  I've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings,  says King, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between King and Francisco Huizar that was recorded, followed by King learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this.  My marriage was murdered,  says King. Last week, a Durham County judge agreed, ordering Huizar to pay $2.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in North Carolina each year settled out of court. But this was  a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors,  King's attorney tells WRAL. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property. It's  archaic … and should be stricken,  says Huizar's lawyer, who claims King was controlling of his unhappy wife.  Verdicts like these … remove personal responsibility for a person's own marriage.

"(Jun 26, 2015  8:24 AM CDT) The State Department is still poring over 55,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails, but officials made an important announcement yesterday: She didn't turn over at least 15 work-related emails as requested, the New York Times reports. How the discovery was made: The House committee looking into the Benghazi debacle subpoenaed correspondence from longtime Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and the State Department cross-referenced the emails he handed over and the ones Clinton did. It found nine emails Blumenthal had were completely missing from her files, as well as parts of six others. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chair of the Benghazi committee, calls the findings  significant  and  troubling  and says that Blumenthal was passing along  unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat  from a source who reportedly had a financial interest in Libya, reports Fox News. But Clinton aides say she handed over all Blumenthal emails, plus a dozen more that he didn't turn in—and that there's no proof the 15 messages in question were actually sent in the form of an email, as Blumenthal compiled the records he handed over into a Microsoft Word document, the AP reports. Officials say that while some are Libya-related, the Blumenthal messages to Clinton don't directly deal with the 2012 Benghazi attacks: Instead, they discuss topics such as media reports about the death of one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons and the inner workings of Libyan rebels. Gowdy isn’t convinced the messages are moot, however.  This has implications far beyond Libya, Benghazi, and our committee's work,  he said in a statement, per CNN.

He originally told police the shooting was unintentional, but authorities say their investigation has led them to believe the boy  intentionally shot Mrs. Smothers in the back of the head as she sat in her living room watching television,  CNN reports. The gun belonged to Smothers, reports WBRZ. Authorities say they still don't know what the boy's motive was.  By accounts of relatives of the victim, as well as friends of the family, the victim and the juvenile had a normal, loving, relationship,  the local sheriff's department said in a statement, per CNN, adding, however, that he was playing  Grand Theft Auto IV  on his Play Station minutes before the shooting, which it describes as  a realistic game that has been associated with encouraging violence and awards points to players for killing people.  Because he is under 10, the boy can't be charged for the crime under Louisiana law.","Boy, 8, Shoots, Kills Elderly Woman—Intentionally","Boy, ____, Shoots, Kills Elderly Woman—Intentionally",8,Copy( 8 ),0

"(Mar 4, 2017  5:58 AM) Jordan on Saturday executed 10 men convicted in a series of bombings and shooting attacks since 2003 that killed a British tourist, an outspoken critic of Islamic extremism, and members of the Jordanian security forces, a government spokesman said. It was the largest round of executions in recent memory, and the first since pro-Western Jordan launched a crackdown on Islamic extremists two years ago, after the killing of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot by ISIS, the AP reports. The prisoners were hanged at dawn Saturday at Swaqa Prison, about 47 miles south of the capital, Amman, the spokesman said. Five others were executed for other crimes, including incest. The assailants executed for terror convictions had been involved in six different incidents, including a 2003 bombing attack that killed 19 at Jordan's embassy in Iraq to the September 2016 shooting of local writer Nahed Hattar on the steps of an Amman courthouse. Analyst Labib Kamhawi said he believes the executions were meant to send a triple message. They signaled to potential attackers that they can expect harsh punishment and reminded ordinary Jordanians that their country faces a serious security threat, he said. The message to the outside world, particularly the Trump administration, is that  Jordan is on top of things and that Jordan can be considered one of the allies in fighting terrorism,  Kamhawi says.","Jordan Executes 15, Including Terrorists","Jordan Executes ____, Including Terrorists",15,"Add( 10 , Trans( Five ) )",1

Shattuck, due back in court in December, pleaded not guilty and was released on $84,000 bail, reports the Baltimore Sun. She is the mother of three, the oldest of whom is a classmate of the alleged victim. Police outline the alleged timeline in court documents: They say that Shattuck commented on photos of the teen on Instagram in May; Shattuck's son then reportedly gave the boy his mom's cell phone number and prodded him to text her, saying  she is obsessed with you.  The former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader later allegedly had make-out sessions with the teen in the back of her Cadillac Escalade, and invited him (along with her children and their friends) to her beach rental over Labor Day, where she allegedly performed oral sex on him.

"(Mar 22, 2018  2:37 AM CDT) A Tennessee man who was wrongfully imprisoned for more than half his life has finally received compensation—almost a decade after he was set free and handed a check for just $75. Lawrence McKinney, 61, was convicted of rape and burglary in 1978 but the conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in 2009 after DNA evidence cleared him of the crime. But despite the evidence, the parole board refused to grant him a complete exoneration, meaning McKinney was unable to seek compensation from the state until Gov. Bill Haslam granted him an executive exoneration in December, citing authorities' finding that McKinney  would not have been prosecuted if the DNA testing results had been available at the time of trial,  Fox 17 reports. On Wednesday, the Tennessee Board of Claims voted unanimously to give McKinney the maximum $1 million compensation for the lost 31 years of his life, the Tennessean reports. The former inmate, who married prison pen pal Dorothy after his release, will receive $353,000 up front to cover debts and attorneys' fees, with the remaining $647,000 funding an annuity that will pay him $3,350 a month.  We want to thank the board and the governor for standing by this man and seeing that justice was done,  attorney David Raybin says. When he was formally exonerated, McKinney said being vindicated was more important than the money.  I never doubted it because God is in control,  he said.

"(Dec 21, 2017  4:41 PM) The wave of sexual misconduct allegations that toppled Hollywood power brokers, politicians, media icons, and many others was the top news story of 2017, according to the AP's annual poll of US editors and news directors. The first AP top-stories poll was conducted in 1936, when editors chose the abdication of Britain's King Edward VIII as the top story. Here are 2017's top 10 stories, in reverse order:  10. Islamic State: After lengthy assaults, an array of forces drove ISIS from its two main strongholds—the city of Mosul in Iraq, and its self-styled capital, Raqqa, in Syria. The defeats left the Islamic State without significant territory in either country, but affiliates elsewhere in the region, particularly in Egypt and Afghanistan, continued to operate. 9. Worldwide terror attacks: The first big terror attack of 2017 came on New Year's Day—a gunman killing 39 at a nightclub in Istanbul. Subsequent targets of global terror included an Ariana Grande concert in England, a bike path in New York City, and the historic La Rambla promenade in Barcelona. In October, a truck bombing in Somalia killed more than 500 people; in November, an attack on a crowded mosque in Egypt killed more than 300.  4. Hurricane onslaught: In a four-week span, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria ravaged Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean islands. Harvey killed more than 80 people in Texas and caused an estimated $150 billion in damage. Irma killed scores of people in the Caribbean and US, including 12 residents of a Florida nursing home that lost its air conditioning. Maria damaged more than 200,000 homes in Puerto Rico, caused lengthy power outages, and prompted an investigation into whether the official death toll of 64 was vastly undercounted. 3. Las Vegas mass shooting: A 64-year-old high-stakes video poker player, after amassing an arsenal of weapons, unleashed a barrage of gunfire from a high-rise casino-hotel that killed 58 people and injured hundreds among a crowd attending an open-air concert along the Las Vegas Strip. Weeks after the massacre, questions about the gunman's motives remained unanswered. 2. Trump-First Year: The controversies started on Inauguration Day, with the new president challenged over his claims on the size of the crowd, and persisted throughout the year. Trump's approval ratings hovered around record-low territory, his base remained fiercely loyal, and his relentless tweeting—often in the early morning hours—provoked a striking mix of outrage, mockery, and grateful enthusiasm. 1. Sexual misconduct: Scandals involving sexual misdeeds by prominent men are nothing new in America, but there's never been anything remotely like the deluge of allegations unleashed this year by women who were emboldened to speak out by the accusers who preceded them. Luminaries toppled from their perches included movie magnate Harvey Weinstein, media stars Bill O'Reilly, Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, and several celebrity chefs and members of Congress.",These Are the 10 Biggest News Stories of the Year,These Are the ____ Biggest News Stories of the Year,10,Copy( 10 ),0

Police say Malachi was at his mother's home in Somersworth when 33-year-old Jeremiah Grant took off with him in a gray 1991 Honda Accord while she was distracted, WMUR reports. An Amber Alert had been issued, and police correctly thought Grant may have gone to Maine, where he's a registered sex offender, CBS Boston reports. Police had believed Grant—who is 6 feet tall, weighs 275 pounds, and has tattoos including the words  Alpha Male  on his neck and  INSANE  on his left forearm—to be a danger both to himself and the boy.  There were comments made during the course of the day that lead us to believe that the child is in danger,  a police spokesman initially told WMUR.

If you read the description of the menu item, available since October, you certainly wouldn't think so: It packs chicken, pork sausage, rice, beans, and cheese into a tortilla. Except that same sign also said  300 calories.  And so three customers who bought the burrito in Los Angeles this month are suing. As City News Service reports, one of the men behind the proposed class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the menu item on Nov. 3 thinking it was a 300-calorie dish. David Desmond  felt excessively full and realized that the burrito couldn’t have been just 300 calories  after eating it, per the complaint. LV Anderson does the math at Slate, and reports the true total is closer to 1,050 calories. (That's par for the course at Chipotle, according to this 2015 New York Times article.) The suit would cover  all people who bought food at Chipotle for four years leading up to the filing of the complaint,  even though the chorizo filling is a new menu offering. That's because the plaintiffs are alleging the signage is part of a pattern by the chain of presenting misleading nutritional information. CNBC reports Chipotle didn't respond to its request for comment, but Chipotle did reply to some customers who tweeted their disbelief about the calorie count:  I'm sorry for the confusion, but we'll make things more clear next time.

"(Jan 28, 2015  11:04 PM) The investigation into the huge blaze that killed a Maryland couple and their four grandchildren earlier this month has pinned the blame on a major fire hazard right in the middle of the mansion's  Great Room : A 2-month-old, 15-foot Christmas tree. Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say.  The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did,  a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would  without a doubt  have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the Pyles had a tradition of extending Christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree  lit most of the time,  WBAL reports.

"(Feb 17, 2019  9:17 AM) The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund is quickly running out of money, and claimants will be getting payouts that are slashed by at least half, reports NPR. The $7.3 billion fund, which opened in 2011 and is set to expire in December 2020, has faced a surge in new claims as it winds down. Pending claims will be paid at 50%, while any claims filed after Feb. 1 will be paid at 30%.  I am painfully aware of the inequity of the situation,  says fund administrator Rupa Bhattacharyya.  But the stark reality of the data leaves me no choice. If there had been a different option available to me, I assure you I would have taken it.  The numbers are pretty dire: The fund has paid out about $5 billion to 21,000 people; another 19,000 claims remain unpaid. A 235% surge in claims since December 2015 isn't necessarily due to a race to cash in before the fund closes, so much as cancer latency periods and what Bhattacharyya says is a lack of  a good estimate of how many potential claimants there are, partly because there's never been a good estimate of how many people were exposed.

"(Nov 18, 2015  12:11 AM) Uber says it's now making  house calls,  at least for one day. The ride-sharing service says that after the success of last year's program, it is offering flu shots to people in 35 cities for $10 between 11am and 3pm on Thursday, Nov. 19, the Washington Post reports. The shot—technically free, as long as a $10  wellness pack  is purchased—comes with a nurse, who will actually deliver up to 10 shots with the purchase of that single pack, meaning you and your co-workers can take care of business for the low, low cost of $1 each. Of course, there may be a tussle over who gets to keep the pack, which includes an UberHEALTH-branded water bottle and tote, tissues, hand sanitizer, and a lollipop. Those who select the UberHEALTH option via their app are asked to  select a suitable indoor location prior to UberHEALTH arriving,  and the shot may be administered to those ages 4 and up. The nurses will be provided by a company called Passport Health, which will share the costs of the program with Uber and health data-mining firm Epidemico, reports the Chicago Tribune. It adds that 10,000 shots will be available; 2,000 vaccinations were given in just four cities by Uber last year. Instructions on how to take part, and a list of all the cities covered, can be found on Uber's  UberHealth  page.

The win gives Germany top honors for Group G, which had been touted as the tournament's  group of death.  But the US will be moving on, too, because Portugal defeated Ghana by a score of 2-1 in another game happening simultaneously.

"(Feb 22, 2017  1:09 PM) A STAT investigation reveals that more than 370 infants and toddlers got sick after their parents gave them Hyland's teething tablets or gel, a homeopathic remedy the FDA has been warning about for years. Eight children died, though the FDA is still reviewing whether the products are to blame. STAT used a Freedom of Information Act Request to obtain FDA records documenting problems possibly tied to the products from 2006 to 2016, and those documents cast a light on incidents in which babies stopped breathing, had seizures, or worse. The FDA was specifically concerned with the ingredient atropa belladonna—also known as deadly nightshade. Many of the symptoms reported are consistent with belladonna toxicity; though the herb can be used in a diluted form safely, the FDA found  inconsistent  amounts in Hyland's products. The company says that its products are safe and that the FDA has not proven a link between them and the problems.  That doesn’t mean that children don’t have a sensitivity to a product,  says a spokeswoman.  There is a lot of sensitivity on kids’ parts and we have to watch carefully. It’s not something that condemns the entire product line.  It wasn't until 2010 that the FDA issued its first warning about the products, and not until September 2016 did the agency issue a more serious warning, after which Hyland's said it would stop manufacturing the products in question. The FDA doesn't oversee homeopathic products the way it does pharmaceutical products; the agency is only tasked with determining whether homeopathic products are unsafe after they're on the market. In response to the Hyland's controversy, a congresswoman has introduced a bill that would give the FDA authority to recall homeopathic products.

"(Feb 23, 2018  9:42 AM) The large trust left behind for his daughter by the King of Rock and Roll has been reduced to a reported $14,000 in cash, and Lisa Marie Presley is now suing her former manager for $100 million because of it. Presley—who is reportedly $16 million in debt—argues her fortune was lost because Barry Siegel failed to alert her to inappropriate spending (on expensive homes, mainly) and made a bad investment, reports TMZ. After selling 85% of Presley's shares in Elvis Presley Enterprises for $100 million in 2005, Siegel invested in Core Entertainment, the parent company of American Idol, according to Presley. When the company went bankrupt more than a decade later, Presley says she lost $24.5 million. In a countersuit, Siegel tells a very different story. The 2005 sale of Presley's shares  cleared up over $20 million in debts Lisa had incurred and netted her over $40 million cash and a multi-million dollar income stream, most of which she managed to squander in the ensuing years,  Siegel's attorney says, per the New York Daily News. She  refused to listen to the warnings of her most trusted advisers and her family  and eventually stopped paying Siegel, according to the suit. She is  looking to blame others  but  has only herself to blame for her financial and personal misfortunes,  it adds. As part of proceedings for her divorce from Michael Lockwood, Presley has claimed she owes $10 million in unpaid taxes, $6 million from the purchase of a UK home, and $500,000 in other unpaid fees, per Us Weekly.

"(Nov 13, 2013  4:42 PM) The tech world is abuzz today with a Wall Street Journal report that photo-sharing service Snapchat got a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook—and said thanks, but no thanks. It seems that 23-year-old CEO Evan Spiegel isn't ready to even consider offers at this point given his company's growing number of users. Besides, Facebook may have undershot the mark—another offer reportedly in the work from China's Tencent Holdings values Snapchat at $4 billion, notes the Journal. Snapchat's niche is that it allows users to send photos and messages that soon self-destruct. (Though there's some doubt about that.)  This makes it perfect for sharing naughty photos with loved ones, which isn’t advertised by Snapchat, but can be somewhat attributed to its popularity,  writes Tom Cheredar at Venture Beat.

"(Jul 14, 2017  7:13 AM CDT) Millions of Americans who rely on Social Security can expect to see their biggest pay increase in years in January, per projections released Thursday by the program's trustees, the AP reports. The increase is projected to be just 2.2%, or about $28 a month for the average recipient. For context, this year Social Security recipients saw an increase of 0.3%, after getting nothing in 2016. Some good news for seniors: The trustees project Medicare Part B premiums will stay unchanged next year. Most beneficiaries pay $134 a month, though retirees with higher incomes pay more. Both Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment and Medicare Part B premiums will be announced in the fall. More than 61 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses, and surviving children receive Social Security benefits, with an average monthly payment of $1,253. Medicare provides health insurance to about 58 million people. Unless Congress acts, the trust funds that support Social Security are estimated to run dry in 2034, the same as last year's projection. Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care is projected to be depleted in 2029, a year later than last year's forecast. Over the past decade, Social Security and Medicare made up about 40% of federal spending, excluding interest on the debt; 50 years ago, the figure was 16%. The programs are expanding in part because the US is growing older: In 1960, there were 5.1 workers for each person getting Social Security benefits; today, there are about 2.8 workers for each beneficiary.",Social Security Recipients Projected to Get 2.2% Raise,Social Security Recipients Projected to Get ____% Raise,2.2,Copy( 2.2 ),0
"(Jan 5, 2017  7:33 AM) A pregnant Alabama woman who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks can sue her doctor for wrongful death, the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled, with judges citing a 2009 state law making it a crime to kill or harm  an unborn child in utero at any stage of development.  Physicians who make mistakes are usually protected from civil suits, and a lower court in August dismissed the wrongful death portion of Kimberly Stinnett's claim. But the high court overruled that last week in a unanimous decision that  reaffirms the principle that unborn children are protected by Alabama's wrongful-death statute from the moment life begins,  writes Judge Tom Parker, per AL.com. The ruling is a swipe at Roe v. Wade, which Parker has previously called  incoherent  because  life begins at conception.  The case goes back to May 2012, when Stinnett sought treatment for abdominal cramps and fever. An ER obstetrician who treated her suspected an ectopic pregnancy and performed a dilation and curettage, AL.com reports, followed by an injection of a drug intended to stop the pregnancy. The Helena woman had a history of two miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy. A follow-up ultrasound by Stinnett's regular OB-GYN showed the pregnancy was uterine but failing, possibly because of the injection. In June, Stinnett miscarried and filed a civil lawsuit against the doctor who first treated her. ProPublica has written that Parker's writings pose  the biggest threat to abortion in a generation,  but the ruling was cheered by the chair of Liberty Counsel  for defending the legal rights of the unborn as clearly stated in Alabama law.

"(Mar 17, 2016  9:34 AM CDT) More than a dozen US military personnel have been disciplined, but face no criminal charges, for errors that led to the aerial attack on a civilian hospital that killed 42 people in northern Afghanistan last year, say US defense officials speaking anonymously. Per the AP, the officials say the disciplinary process is nearly complete and is derived from a military investigation of the Oct. 3, 2015, attack on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz by a US Air Force special ops AC-130 gunship, one of the most lethal in the US arsenal. The punishments, which have not been publicly announced, are largely administrative. Some actions, such as letters of reprimand, are enough to effectively end chances for further promotion; the military has previously said some personnel were suspended from their duties. The disciplined include both officers and enlisted personnel, but none are generals. The attack, which the medical charity has called  relentless and brutal,  was unleashed as US military advisers were helping Afghan forces retake Kunduz from the Taliban. The US military's outline of what happened: The crew of the AC-130 had been dispatched to hit a Taliban command center in a different building, 450 yards away from the hospital. However, hampered by targeting sensor issues, the crew relied on a physical description that led them to begin firing at the hospital, though they saw no hostile activity there. A separate US report obtained last fall by the AP said the AC-130 fired 211 shells at the hospital over 29 minutes before commanders realized the mistake. Army Gen. John Campbell, the top US commander in Afghanistan at the time, has called it a  tragic but avoidable accident caused primarily by human error.  A DWB rep says the charity won't comment on disciplinary actions until the Pentagon communicates its decisions directly to the group or makes a public announcement.",US Disciplines at Least 12 for Airstrike on Hospital,US Disciplines at Least ____ for Airstrike on Hospital,12,Trans( a dozen ),1
"(Apr 24, 2013  1:39 PM CDT) The Earned Income Tax Credit is that rare IRS feature popular with politicians, economists, and especially with the low-income families it helps, notes the Hill. No wonder: Turns out, the IRS is overly generous with the credit. An audit shows that it distributed between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion in improper EITC refunds last year. That accounts for up to 25% of all such refunds. And it's no fluke: That amount is actually a marked improvement from previous years, reports the Washington Post. One of the big problems apparently is that rules surrounding the credit are so confusing that even professional tax preparers get bamboozled. Nor does it help that families might be eligible one year but not the next.

The federal indictments and plea deal were announced Wednesday by the Justice Department in Washington involving the pollution violation and an elaborate and wide-ranging scheme to cover it up. It's the largest penalty ever levied by the government against an automaker. The deal also requires VW to cooperate in an ongoing probe that could lead to the arrest of more employees. At a press conference Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said  Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied.  VW installed software into diesel engines on some vehicles that allowed the engines to turn on pollution controls during government tests and switch them off in real-world driving. The software, called a  defeat device  because it defeated the emissions controls, improved engine performance but spewed out harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times above the legal limit. Regulators confronted VW employees about the use of the software in the summer of 2015. Volkswagen at first denied using the defeat device, but finally admitted to it in September of that year.

He tells BuzzFeed—where sources estimate the shortfall is closer to $16 million—that the rise of Donald Trump is another reason for the lack of funds, because companies that usually donate to both conventions are shunning the GOP convention because of Trump, and they don't want to appear biased by only donating to the DNC.  We’ve had three blows,  Rendell quips.  The fed, the city, and the Trumpster.  He says it's a  heavy lift,  but he is confident that all $64 million needed to hold the convention will be raised by the end of July. Rendell, a Clinton loyalist, says he worries that Sanders delegates could cause problems inside the convention. Clinton delegates have a  stake in the party,  he says, but  95% of the Bernie delegates don’t give a shit about the Democratic Party or somebody other than Bernie winning the presidency. They could be disruptive in the convention hall—that would be a terrible outcome.

"(Feb 26, 2017  1:32 PM) Iran's navy began an annual drill Sunday near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, its first major exercise since the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, state television reported. The TV report quoted navy chief Adm. Habibollah Sayyari as saying the two-day maneuver will cover an area of 772,000 square miles in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean near the strait, the AP reports. It showed Iranian warships and helicopters taking part in the exercise. Nearly a third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait and it has been the scene of previous confrontations between the US and Iran. But the drill does not involve Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force the US Navy often criticizes for harassing its vessels. The US Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, declined to comment on the exercise or discuss if it had any plans to monitor the drill.

The 3,300-year old mask, whose beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued on with epoxy in 2014, was scratched and damaged as a result of the amateur repair job, prosecutors said in a statement, which implicated the then-head of the Egyptian Museum and the chief of the restoration department.  In an attempt to cover up the damage they inflicted, they used sharp instruments ... to remove traces of adhesive on the mask, causing damage and scratches that remain,  it said, citing an investigation. The eight now face fines and disciplinary measures including dismissal. The mask was put back on display last month after a German-Egyptian team of specialists removed the epoxy and reattached the beard using beeswax, used as an adhesive in antiquity. A year ago, a museum conservator who was present at the time of the repair told the AP that epoxy had dried on the face of the boy king's mask and that a colleague used a spatula to remove it, leaving scratches. Another conservator who inspects the artifact regularly also saw the scratches and said it was clear that they had been made by a tool used to scrape off the epoxy.

Pemex raised the toll from the 13 fatalities previously known and also said 19 people remained hospitalized, with 13 of them in serious condition. Earlier in the day, desperate relatives gathered outside the plant in the industrial port city of Coatzacoalcos, on Mexico's southern Gulf coast, hoping for news about loved ones still unaccounted for. About 30 families massed at a plant entrance road, where a sharp chemical smell still hung in the air about a mile from where the explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon, the AP reports. Shoving broke out as people unsuccessfully tried to force their way into the installation. The blast forced evacuations of nearby areas as it sent a toxin-filled cloud billowing into the air and injuring more than 100 workers. Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, Pemex's director, told Radio Formula that the explosion was caused by a leak of as-yet unknown origin. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto also toured the facility Thursday. A spokesman for a family searching for a lost relative vowed that the families would demand a full account of what happened.

"(Jul 3, 2015  3:51 AM CDT) One of America's ritziest restaurants has been ordered to give around 70 servers a total $500,000 for engaging in what New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman calls some pretty lowly behavior: cheating servers out of their tips. The AG's office says Manhattan restaurant Per Se, which charges $310 for its  tasting menu,  slapped a 20%  service charge  on the bills of private-dining client customers and, in violation of state law, used that money for general operational costs instead of giving it directly to the servers, the New York Daily News reports. The restaurant was also fined $100,000 and will be required to step up compliance with labor laws, reports the New York Times. The settlement ensures that servers  will not continue to be cheated out of their hard-earned tips—tips that customers intended for them,  Schneiderman said. In a statement to CNBC, the restaurant says the failure to pay the charge to servers was an oversight after state regulations on service charges changed in 2011. Per Se says workers were  never short-changed and no monies intended for employees were withheld,  and the charge helped pay for  industry-leading wages  that average $116,000 a year for a waiter, including overtime and tips.

Jennifer Fitzgerald reached the settlement with the city this month. How on earth did the fees get so high?

"(Jul 5, 2012  6:08 AM CDT) With would-be homebuyers continuing to sit on the sidelines, rental vacancies dropped to a 10-year low last quarter, driving up rental prices to record levels around the United States, reports the Wall Street Journal. Rental prices have reached record highs in 74 of 82 markets measured by real estate tracking firm Reis. The biggest climb last quarter came from New York City, where average rents jumped 1.7% to a hefty $2,935 per month.  The market is in a very tight position,  Reis said in a research report.  There is a paucity of available units.  Nationwide, rental vacancy rates are just 4.7%—only the third quarter in 30 years they have been below 5%—down significantly from 8% in 2009, around the worst part of the economic downturn. But with people worried about job security, tighter lending standards, and wariness over long-term housing prices, rental demand is expanded to stay strong, pushing rents ever higher. The one wildcard, however, is new apartment construction—builders are racing to begin 235,000 units this year, then 285,000 in 2013, and 320,000 in 2014.

The boy, now 15 years old, was a third-grader when police accused him of using a .22-caliber rifle to shoot his father and his father's friend as they returned home from work in 2008. No exact motive was revealed, although the boy referred to spankings in discussions with child welfare investigators. The boy pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of Tim Romans, 39, and prosecutors dropped a premeditated murder charge in his 29-year-old father's death in exchange for the plea. The plea deal called for the boy to be sent to treatment facilities and undergo intensive probation until he's 18. His latest evaluations show he doesn't pose a threat to himself or others, allowing him to join a regular classroom and move to a foster home that's more like a family setting, his attorney says.  He's not just a teenager. He's the teenager who murdered his father, so that puts him in a special category of scrutiny,  the attorney says.

"(May 11, 2018  11:40 AM CDT) Hoping to cripple organized crime and tamp down on tax evasion and money laundering, Australia has announced its latest tactic: not allowing cash purchases over $7,500 for goods and services. The West Australian reports the new rule—which will require consumers to use a check or electronic service such as a debit or credit card if a purchase goes over that amount—will take effect in July 2019. Exempt from the mandate will be transactions with financial institutions and those taking place between consumers for non-business-related purposes. The Guardian notes that the measure is part of the government's attempts to tackle the country's so-called  black economy.   This will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists, and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax,  said Treasurer Scott Morrison, per Gizmodo.

In an internal memo obtained Friday by the AP, Delta Air Lines said gate agents can offer up to $2,000, up from a previous maximum of $800, and supervisors can offer up to $9,950, up from $1,350. United is reviewing its own policies, including incentives for customers, and will announce any actions by April 30, a spokesperson said. The airline would not disclose its current compensation limit. Other airlines did not immediately comment on whether they would raise their ceiling. Ben Schlappig, a travel blogger who first wrote about the Delta compensation increase, said it shows Delta is trying to reduce forced bumping. He said he couldn't imagine many situations in which people wouldn't jump at nearly $10,000. Delta no doubt hopes that gate agents and their supervisors won't need to make maximum offers, and the financial cost to the airline is likely to be limited. If Delta paid $9,950 to every person it bumped involuntarily last year, that would total $12 million. Delta earned nearly $4.4 billion. After the incident last Sunday, critics questioned why United didn't offer more when no passengers accepted the airline's $800 offer for volunteers to give up their seats.

Boaters off Long Island and Connecticut have been capturing images of belugas, humpbacks, and at least one minke starting in May, when three belugas were seen near Fairfield, Conn. But while the creatures provide perfect photo ops (especially breaching humpbacks), NOAA warns people to keep their distance, the AP notes.

What's more, between 1986 and 2010, American obesity increased the most on the East Coast, which has the highest levels of CO2. The researcher speculates that carbon dioxide affects certain hormones in the brain that dictate how much food we eat and energy we expend. To test the theory, researchers put six men into different climate-controlled rooms; some were exposed to extra carbon dioxide. Afterward, the men were asked to eat as much as they wanted. Those who'd experienced the higher CO2 ate 6% more than their peers.

Police say a man dressed all in black with a yellow bandanna over his face forced the teen into an SUV outside her home in the Rosewood mobile home park as she waited for a ride to school just before 7am, the News & Observer reports. The vehicle belonged to one of her relatives.  After grabbing the child, he forced her into the 2002 Green Ford Expedition and stole it and drove away,  police told reporters Monday. Police say Hania, who is in the eighth grade at Lumberton High School, is approximately 5 feet tall and weighs 126 pounds. She has long black hair, brown eyes, and braces and was last seen wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt with a flower pattern, Fox News reports. According to the Amber Alert, the SUV has the license plate number NWS-984. The FBI says  the paint on the hood is peeling and there is a Clemson sticker on the rear window.   Our main concern right now is to get this young lady back to her family,  says Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeil, who urges anybody who sees the girl or the vehicle to call 910-671-3845.","Girl 13, Kidnapped Outside Home","Girl ____, Kidnapped Outside Home",13,Copy( 13 ),0

Midnight,  of course, being the end of civilization. The organization cited concerns about the world's nuclear arsenals, but it also placed a big share of the blame for the time change on global warming and what it sees as political inaction to get it under control, reports the Guardian.  Human influence on the climate system is clear,  said Richard Somerville of the Bulletin.  Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer than any preceding on record.  This is the closest we've come to the group's Doomsday since the US and the Soviet Union were in the grips of the Cold War in 1984.

"(Oct 31, 2014  7:43 AM CDT) Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned—especially one in an arranged marriage in which her husband has rejected her. An Indian bride filed charges in Bangalore this month, claiming that not only was her husband cheating on her, but that he violated a colonial-era law that bans  carnal intercourse against the order of nature with a man, woman, or animal,  the New York Times reports. The activity in question was her husband having sexual relations with another man—and she had the footage to prove it. The woman knew something was wrong right after their nuptials last November, One India reports: Her husband, a software engineer, wouldn't touch her; when she complained to his parents, they became  hostile,  the Times notes. The wife suspected either impotence (he refused to see a doctor) or adultery. The camera she set up in their home recorded him having a sexual encounter with a man—a violation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. He was arrested. Not many people have been prosecuted under this 1861 law, but conviction could mean life in jail; meanwhile, a  lighter  charge of simple adultery would only result in a max of five years in jail, India's Telegraph reports. This case has reinvigorated the debate not only about the continued stigma against homosexuality (a lower court in 2009 legalized gay sex by striking down the colonial-era law; last December the Supreme Court reinstated it), but also about arranged marriage itself.  Had [the arrested man] been comfortable enough to talk about his sexuality, he probably would not have been forced into a marriage like this,  an activist tells the Times.

"(May 18, 2016  10:18 AM CDT) Alanis Morissette has had to swallow a jagged little pill: The Canadian singer says she was robbed of almost $5 million. The alleged culprit? Her former business manager to the stars. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Morissette says she fired Jonathan Schwartz of GSO Business Management—whose clients have reportedly included Beyonce and Mariah Carey—in March and learned shortly after that he had taken $4.7 million from her accounts without permission from 2010 to 2014. Schwartz told her new manager that Morissette  spends a lot of cash so I get large amounts from the bank, and keep the money in my safe  for when she needs it, the complaint reads. But after Morissette disputed that, she says Schwartz claimed she put the money into illegal marijuana grow-ops, per Courthouse News. Schwartz also let Morissette transfer $8 million out of her investment accounts and didn't tell her she  dipped into her savings,  the suit alleges, per the Wall Street Journal.  Defendants concealed distributions from Morissette, convincing her that she was in tremendous financial shape when, in fact, they were draining her assets.  Specifically, Morissette says Schwartz convinced her not to perform five shows in Las Vegas because she was  set for life.  She's seeking more than $15 million. GSO says it was  shocked  by its own investigation into Schwartz, whom the firm accuses of  burning through money to sustain a lavish lifestyle  in a lawsuit filed Monday. It maintains, however, that Morissette requested large amounts of cash and often went over budget, per the BBC.

"(Dec 10, 2016  10:05 AM) Employees at the Calgary Zoo made a horrifying discovery Thursday morning: seven dead Humboldt penguins, all apparently drowned in a 3-feet-deep pool.  Everybody here is pretty shaken up by it,  animal care director Jamie Dorgan tells CBC News. The penguins were being kept in a holding area this week while their habitat at the Canadian zoo was under renovation, the Guardian reports. According to the New York Daily News, it's unclear what happened to the penguins, who were between 7 and 8 months old and free of infections.  It’s a very odd situation, very odd circumstances, and nothing we’ve ever encountered before,  Dorgan tells the Guardian. A biology professor says penguins drowning is  a pretty rare event,  but the zoo believes the animals—22 in all—may have been spooked by something during the night, panicked, and tried to jump into the pool at once, causing seven to drown. The remaining 15 appear to be fine, though they are being kept away from the pools at night as a precaution. The Calgary Zoo has had its share of animal mishaps. In February, an otter drowned after getting tangled in a pair of pants given to it as a present by a zookeeper. Over the past eight years, a capybara was crushed by a hydraulic door, a gorilla got a hold of a knife, 41 stingrays died, and a group of gorillas raided a kitchen.

"(May 13, 2020  9:25 AM CDT) Ahmaud Arbery died of  multiple shotgun wounds sustained during a struggle for the shotgun,  according to an autopsy by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The April 1 autopsy report concluded the 25-year-old was shot three times on Feb. 23, including twice in the chest. Eleven shotgun pellets were removed from Arbery's chest, while 13 exited his back, per CNN and ABC News. The pellets caused injuries throughout Arbery’s body, including a damaged right lung, fractured left upper arm and shoulder blade, and a  deep, gaping, shotgun graze  to his right wrist. There were no drugs or alcohol in his system. The GBI is now investigating the two district attorneys who recused themselves from the case before Gregory McMichael, a former Glynn County police officer, and his son, Travis, were arrested and charged with murder on Thursday. State Attorney General Chris Carr  is concerned that the actions of these offices in possibly misrepresenting or failing to disclose information during the process of appointing a conflict prosecutor to investigate the death of Ahmaud Arbery may have constituted unprofessional conduct,  the GBI says. When Brunswick Judicial Circuit's Jackie Johnson dropped the case, she advised Carr to appoint Waycross Judicial Circuit's George Barnhill. Days earlier, Barnhill had told Glynn County police  that he did not see grounds for the arrest of any of the individuals involved,  according to GBI. Barnhill ultimately held onto the case for weeks after discovering a conflict of interest, per CNN.

However, the story emphasizes that neither Obama nor wife Michelle is expected to issue an endorsement in the primary. The former president doesn't see that as his role, and that would remain the case even if his former VP, Joe Biden, enters the race. The story says the two have discussed the race, however, and the best Biden can hope for is that Obama will say good things about his tenure as a running mate and vice president. Obama has spoken with more than a dozen declared or potential candidates, per the Times, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Michael Bloomberg, and Obama's former attorney general, Eric Holder. Politico, meanwhile, notes that many polls have Biden leading the Democratic contenders with roughly 30% of the prospective vote. However, the story throws cold water on a lead of that size. Factoring in undecided voters, it figures Biden's backing is closer to 10%.  I think the reason that so many people are getting in is because this is a 1-to-15% spread, not a 1-to-30% spread,  says one analyst.

It’s worrisome that such a large percentage of Americans have so little set aside,  a financial analyst for the site that conducted the survey tells Market Watch.  They likely don’t have cash reserves to cover an emergency and will have to rely on credit, friends, and family.  The survey of 5,000 people found that 62% of Americans have less than $1,000 saved, while only 14% had more than $10,000 in their savings account. These numbers come despite a September survey showing Americans are getting more interested in—and being more effective at—saving money, CNBC reports. Last month's numbers for interest, effectiveness, and effort toward saving were the highest ever for the survey. However the survey did come to the obvious conclusion that the country's biggest earners—those making more than $100,000 a year—were by far better at saving money than those in a lower income bracket.

Clark's case against Adam Clark and Kimberly Barrett also included accusations of libel—she claimed he falsely posted online that she had herpes and an eating disorder—and alienation-of-affection, which refers to a 3rd party breaking up a marriage. That marriage began in April 2010 and produced two children. She alleged that her husband, an Army major, and Barrett, an Army lieutenant colonel, met six years later at a Virginia base. A 2018 report on the case from the Daily News of Jacksonville quotes the suit as saying Elizabeth Clark noticed a change while her husband was in Virginia:  His mobile device began to show his location at the opposite end of the hotel where his room was located. Additionally, his credit card charges doubled for routine expenses such as meals and entertainment.  The suit says he ultimately admitted to the affair. Elizabeth Clark's lawyer described Barrett as over 40, wanting kids, and deciding to pull Adam Clark away from his wife in order to achieve that. The lawyer said the two have since had a child. As for the revenge-porn part of the suit, Elizabeth Clark claimed Adam Clark posted topless photos of her online. Adam Clark is to pay $2 million of the total and Barrett the rest.","Woman's Ex, His Girlfriend Ordered to Pay Her $3.2M","Woman's Ex, His Girlfriend Ordered to Pay Her $____M",3.2,Copy( 3.2 ),0
"(Oct 9, 2020  7:44 AM CDT) A Nobel laureate who helped prove how dangerous chlorofluorocarbons are to the ozone layer and who served as a scientific adviser to President Obama has died. Dr. Mario Molina, a US citizen born in Mexico, passed away Wednesday at the age of 77 at his Mexico City home, the Washington Post reports. When Dr. Molina first started studying CFCs—industrial chemicals used in coolants for air conditioners and refrigerators, deodorant sprays, and other aerosols—it wasn't believed they caused any harm to the environment. Along with UC Irvine professor F. Sherwood Rowland, however, Molina discovered that CFCs actually did pose a significant danger, by depleting the ozone layer. That discovery led to the scientists winning the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen. Now, the world says goodbye to the man called  one of the single most important contributors to climate protection in world history  by former White House climate adviser Paul Bledsoe, per Science. Molina's environmental nonprofit says he died of  unexpected cardiac problems,  Reuters reports. Molina's work jump-started international efforts to curb CFCs, including 1987's Montreal Protocol, which imposed regulations on man-made chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. Environmental attorney Durwood Zaelke says Molina always remained a  gentleman,  even when the chemicals industry  vilified  him for his work against CFCs.  Mario never, never changed his willingness to fight,  Zaelke says.

His main contact was the firm’s chief lobbyist, Mitchell Delk. Delk says he never asked Gingrich to do any lobbying  of any kind  for him, however, and that he instead provided  counsel on public policy issues.  But former Freddie Mac officials say Gingrich was asked to help the company reach out to congressional Republicans in 2006, and to help craft arguments to win over conservatives skeptical of the firm’s public-private structure. He was also supposed to provide a white paper for this purpose, but never did so. In the debate, Gingrich said he’d just been a  historian  for the company, and had told them their lending practices were  insane,  but all of Bloomberg’s sources agree that he never criticized the company.

Asteroid 2013 TX68 is scheduled to pass us by on March 5, coming as close as 11,000 miles (or a little more than the distance between Seattle and South Africa), CBS News reports. However it could also be as far away as 9 million miles. According to Gizmodo, the asteroid's most likely path puts it at a distance of 1 million miles from Earth. Amateur astronomers should be at the ready anyway, as a flyby at the closer end of the asteroid's range would make it visible with a telescope. The asteroid, which was discovered in October 2013, passed by Earth two years ago at a distance of 1.3 million miles. Even though it's predicted to possibly come closer this time around, NASA states there is no chance it will hit the Earth. According to a press release, there is a one in 250 million chance it will collide with the planet during another flyby in 2017, though NASA says that probability is  too small to be of any real concern.  And at only 100-feet in diameter, our atmosphere would likely break it up before it made contact.

Some of the 7,000 counter-protesters confronted a small group of  alt-right  protesters who had originally intended to gather for a  No to Marxism in America  rally that was called off two days earlier, the Daily Californian reports. Anti-fascist and anarchist protesters attacked when Joey Gibson of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer arrived with a handful of supporters, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Arrests were made for offenses including assault, though Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood says officers were told not to actively confront the minority of anarchist demonstrators among the largely peaceful protesters who gathered in a city park, the AP reports. He says that after it became clear that there would not be dueling left-right protests like there were during a rally in April, police decided there was  no need for a confrontation over a grass patch.

Authorities say they bought the drug, formally called U-47700, online from China with the help of friends. Each boy died at home of  acute drug intoxication,  say police in the resort town of Park City. Authorities say the boys enlisted the help of a 15-year-old to order the drug, and he was due in court Friday on charges of felony distribution of a controlled or counterfeit substance and misdemeanor reckless endangerment, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents say a teenage girl also helped by having the drug mailed to her home because the teens figured her parents wouldn't be suspicious. She has not been charged. Pink, or pinkie, is part of a wave of potent synthetic opioids hitting US streets after being churned out in overseas labs, reports the AP. Decades ago, U-47700 was once seen as an alternative to morphine, but it languished until the recent popularity of synthetic opioids. In fact, police found it at the estate of Prince after his fatal overdose. The DEA moved to make U-47700 a banned  Schedule 1  drug in September—meaning it has no medical value but a high abuse potential—but the AP notes that the order has not yet taken effect.

The current owners, a married couple with three children, bought it in June 2014 for nearly $1.4 million. But they refused to move in due to eerie letters they say they received from a person with a  mentally disturbed fixation  on the home. The couple took the house off the market last summer after suing the previous owners. But they put the house up for sale again last week. The six-bedroom, 3½-bathroom home is in Westfield, 25 miles west of New York City. According to an online post, it has high ceilings, fireplaces, and  elegant foyers,  and sits on nearly a half-acre. The listing price is $1.25 million. Current owners Derek and Maria Broaddus claim in their suit that they should have been warned about the letter writer. They want the former owners to refund them the purchase price and pay punitive damages. They claim one of the letters they received read:  Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them too (sic) me.  In their suit, they claim they are unable to live in the home  without extreme anxiety and fear for their children's safety and wellbeing.

"(Dec 13, 2020  5:25 PM) John Le Carré, perhaps the greatest living spy novelist, died Saturday in England. The 89-year-old lost his life to pneumonia, his family said. Le Carré was  an undisputed giant of English literature,  his longtime agent told the Guardian.  He defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power in the decades that followed … I have lost a mentor, an inspiration and most importantly, a friend. We will not see his like again.  Revered for his nuanced, literary thrillers, Le Carré found wide acclaim with The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in 1963 and three 1970s novels featuring George Smiley, a surprisingly short, plump, and understated agent in the era of James Bond. The first, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, was among several Le Carré works adapted by the BBC and Hollywood. Le Carré's other books—including The Night Manager, The Constant Gardener, and A Legacy of Spies—portrayed an ambiguous world of espionage in which protagonists delved into shadows of right and wrong.  Thematically, Le Carré's true subject is not spying,  wrote one author, per the New York Times.  It is the endlessly deceptive maze of human relations.  Born David Cornwell in 1931, Le Carré found work in the secret services in the 1940s and later ran spy operations for the British Foreign Service. He married twice and had a son, Nicholas, who also became a novelist. Le Carré's main love, he said,  was scribbling away like a man in hiding at a poky desk.

Yesterday, federal agents arrested Miller on 33-year-old murder charges after tracking him to Mineola, and Miller was quick to confess. They say Miller shot a man in the head in a parking lot outside a hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1981. The victim, Thomas Waller, was found dead inside his car. Miller was charged with murder and three other felonies, but fled the state. Investigators got a tip that he had been living in Mexico under the name of his deceased cousin, and used that information to trace him to Texas. Miller's wife says her husband claimed he was trying to help his brother during a fight when Waller was killed, and that his relatives in Pennsylvania  didn't want him to come back. They told him to leave.  Oddly, Miller also pleaded guilty in a 1959 murder, but his life sentence was commuted in 1971 after he had served more than 11 years, the Patriot-News reports.

"(Apr 4, 2016  7:16 AM CDT) An Indiana 8th-grader's refusal to complete a school project as assigned is making headlines. The unnamed girl was asked to calculate her body mass index and give the definition for BMI, which is found by multiplying one's weight by 703 and dividing by squared height in inches. But instead of providing the number, she countered with a two-page essay. A  proud  family friend posted photographs of her work on Facebook on March 30. The self-described  bigger girl  opens up about her own body image struggles, which recently involved trying  to wrap Ace bandages around my stomach so I'd look skinnier.  Her concerned parents took her to her doctor,  a man who went to college for eight years studying children's health [and] told me my height and weight are right on track.  She concludes by writing that her BMI is not only  none of your concern  but is also  beautiful,  as is her body. She also argues that BMI is an outdated index that has  absolutely no way of discriminating [between] fat and muscle.  Indeed, a study published in Nature in March finds that almost half of people considered  overweight  through this measure actually have a healthy cardiometabolic profile calculated using such factors as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, while about a third of the  normal  BMI people had unhealthy profiles. But a CDC study to be presented Friday argues in favor of the measure's usefulness; it found that an infant's BMI at 6 to 18 months can predict those who are prone to obesity in early childhood.

It would be hard to describe how alarming this is right now,  an American official tells ABC News. He warns that unless Japan can get all of its crippled nuclear plants under control, the resulting catastrophe will be  deadly for decades.  Japanese military helicopters are today dumping tons of seawater on the plant in a desperate bid to avert a nuclear meltdown, but CBS News notes that TV footage shows the wind apparently causing much of the water to disperse. Australia's ABC News adds that the last-ditch attempt to cool the reactors appears to have had no major effect, with only two of the four drops hitting their mark. The crisis hinges on the pools of water holding radioactive waste; so far, workers have struggled to cool the used nuclear-fuel rods in the pools, the Wall Street Journal notes, and the rods in at least two of the pools are exposed to the air.

The 21-year-old hasn't spoken to her divorced parents, Michael Ricci and Maura McGarvey, since February 2013, when she moved out of her mother's home and in with her paternal grandparents. Those grandparents are the ones who paid for her lawyer, 6ABC reports. The judge cited a New Jersey legal precedent that states divorced parents bear responsibility for their child's college education, regardless of that child's age, in ordering the parents to pay $16,000 toward Ricci's tuition at Pennsylvania's Temple University in this and future years. The parents haven't paid and are appealing.  When he ruled that way, I said there is no way she is getting anything from me until we establish some kind of a relationship again,  Ricci's dad says. Her mom has plenty to say, by way of a lengthy blog post titled  The Age of Entitlement,  in which she describes Ricci as a teen who often drank (and was kicked out of the Disney College Program for drinking) and who  chose to move out  instead of following their rules, which included that she work, do chores, and register for summer school:  The court did not seem to care that ... we told her repeatedly that we simply cannot afford out-of-state tuition.

The five-time Oscar nominee  passed away peacefully after a short illness with those closest to him by his side,  a family rep says, per the BBC. The Guardian describes a chest infection, noting the actor previously revealed he had kidney cancer. Nominated four times for the best actor Academy Award, and once for best supporting actor, Finney got his start at the Royal Shakespeare Company before landing memorable roles in Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Erin Brockovich, Big Fish, and—his last film—Skyfall.

"(Nov 24, 2016  5:15 PM) The European Space Agency's Mars lander ended up as a smudge on the red planet's surface because of what Gizmodo calls a  crazy miscalculation.  According to a report released by the ESA, the Schiaparelli lander had deployed its parachute and was descending normally when the device that measured how fast it was spinning sent erroneous information to the navigation system that led it to conclude that it was below the surface of the planet. The lander, believing it must have landed, ditched its parachute, fired its braking thrusters, activated its on-ground systems—and then plummeted 2.3 miles to the ground. The ESA says the glitch in the Inertial Measurement Unit was a momentary one, reports Reuters. The glitch also occurred during computer simulations of the response to the erroneous information, which should make the problem easy to identify, the ESA says. Schiaparelli was supposed to be testing technology for a 2020 ESA Mars landing and while its mission was much, much shorter than anticipated, the agency says it still picked up some readings from the Martian atmosphere that will be passed to science teams.  We will have learned much from Schiaparelli that will directly contribute to the second ExoMars mission,  says ESA Director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration David Parker.

Where other states' retirement systems try to come up with the most complex investments possible to beat the markets, the 44-year-old Edmundson has a different philosophy when it comes to day-to-day trading:  Do as little as possible, usually nothing,  as the Journal puts it. And by  nothing,  that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices, the elections, or even what Janet Yellen is up to—an approach that's rare among managers of large pension funds, the New York Times noted last year in an article about Edmundson. This laissez-faire tactic has served Edmundson well: His system's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive, if not better, than the pension systems of other states, including the largest public one—California's. Even Edmundson's desk looks like it's his first day on the job, with just basic office supplies, a few family pics, and a printer—no fancy Bloomberg Terminal to monitor real-time market info. Edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds, though one investment strategy expert (who held the job before Edmundson) concedes  doing nothing is harder than it looks  when it comes to showing such restraint.

A senior Bihar health department official, Sanjay Kumar, said the epidemic is showing signs of slowing, with no new deaths on Monday. The fatalities have occurred in 20 of the state's 38 districts, the AP reports. More than 700 cases of encephalitis have been registered since the outbreak began June 1, officials said. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the illness, which can cause swelling of the brain, fever, and vomiting.

The kids, ages 2 to 11, are identified only by their first names, and Lada didn't reveal much else about them other than to say they're all in different foster homes and that their case has been removed from the state website because so many inquiries have poured in. Some critics have suggested the response has been so great because the kids are white: One Overland Park resident, for instance, says the children look like they stepped out of a  Lands' End ad  and that kids of other races—the Star notes Kansas has around 1,200 kids looking for families—don't get the same hype. Still, the director of an unrelated Kansas nonprofit says she hopes the kids end up under one roof.  That bond between siblings is the strongest thing they've got when parents are gone,  she says.

"(Feb 13, 2008  7:54 AM) Six 9/11 suspects detained at Gitmo could be executed at the controversial prison compound if found guilty, legal experts say. Military regulations used to require that executions take place at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, but that rule was amended two years ago to allow prisoners to be executed in  other places.  The creation of a Guantanamo Bay execution chamber would keep the men largely out of the reach of US courts, experts believe.  I think that's the administration's idea, to use Guantanamo as a base to not be under the umbrella of the federal district courts,  said a former Navy attorney. US officials have announced that they will seek the death penalty against the suspects. Any executions would be certain to cause international outrage, although the AP reports that US diplomats have been instructed to remind critics that Nazi war criminals were executed after the Nuremberg trials.",9/11 Executions Could Take Place in Gitmo,____ Executions Could Take Place in Gitmo,9/11,Copy( 9/11 ),0
"(Nov 6, 2020  11:46 AM) China has temporarily banned the entry of foreigners from at least eight countries as COVID-19 cases rise in Europe and elsewhere. Non-Chinese can no longer enter from Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, even if they hold a valid visa or residence permit for China, the AP reports. Embassies in those countries have posted online notices in recent days announcing the temporary suspension of entry. China, where the coronavirus first emerged, has enacted strict measures to guard against new infections from abroad. Health authorities on Friday reported 30 imported cases in the most recent 24-hour period, including 15 in Shanghai. That brought the total number of imported cases during the pandemic to 3,510. China largely closed its borders in March but in recent months, it had relaxed restrictions, allowing some foreign nationals to enter if they tested negative for the virus and spent two weeks in quarantine, AFP reports. The country is now  drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation,  a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday. Citizens of countries including the US are still currently allowed to enter China, but the tightened restrictions require them to obtain a health certificate from a Chinese embassy within 48 hours of travel with results of a nucleic acid test and an antibody test.",China Bans Foreigners From 8 Countries,China Bans Foreigners From ____ Countries,8,Trans( eight ),1

Experts from the Museum of London have uncovered a yard and gallery walls from the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch, just east of London's business district. The Curtain opened in 1577 and was home to Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, until the Globe Theatre was built across the river two years later. Plays premiered at the Curtain are thought to include Henry V, which famously describes the structure as  this wooden O.  Further excavation is planned, and a real estate company redeveloping the site said today it plans to preserve the remains.

Four of the cases involved gay men and three were HIV positive, the Los Angeles Times reports; two of those who died were HIV positive. None of the deceased, who died in February or March, had been in direct contact with each other, the AP notes.  I think the important thing to understand is this is not an epidemic,  the medical director of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center says.  But there's a pretty strong signal that men who have sex with men, at least those who are HIV positive, are at increased risk for invasive meningococcal disease.  Yesterday's news of the deaths comes almost exactly a year after meningitis—a disease spread by contact with saliva or nose mucus—killed another LA man, and a day after the Department of Public Health urged gay men who are HIV positive, or have multiple partners, to get vaccinated. The county is now offering free vaccinations for those without health insurance.  It's like a bad dream, like a bad deja vu,  said a councilman.

He was 77. Hurt, who battled pancreatic cancer, died Friday in London, according to his agent, Charles McDonald. Twice nominated for an Oscar, for playing the tortured John Merrick in David Lynch's The Elephant Man and for his role as the heroin addict Max in Midnight Express, Hurt's career spanned over 50 years. After minor television and film appearances, his breakout came in 1966 as Richard Rich in Fred Zinnemann's A Man For All Seasons, followed by his portrayal of Caligula in the BBC miniseries I, Claudius in 1976. Hurt was also a prolific voice actor, appearing as Hazel in the animated Watership Down, and as Aragorn in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings. He also voiced The Horned King in The Black Cauldron and provided the narration for Dogville. In the Harry Potter films, Hurt played the wand-maker Mr. Ollivander. In recent years, he appeared in notable fare such as Melancholia, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, and Snowpiercer.  We're all just passing time, and occupy our chair very briefly,  Hurt said in a 2015 interview while undergoing treatments for the early stage cancer.

The company announced Wednesday that it  will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America.  In a financial release, Ford said that it plans to transition to just two cars over the next few years: the Ford Mustang and the new Ford Active, a  crossover  vehicle to be released next year. Ford currently sells the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, C-Max, Mustang, and Taurus sedans and coupes in North America reports TechCrunch, which notes that the Lincoln sedans are also expected to vanish. Ford hasn't said exactly when the Taurus and other models will be phased out, but the company's statement says almost 90% of its North America portfolio will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles by 2020. Auto industry experts say the move is a bold one, but not totally unexpected, given the continuing shift among consumers away from cars and toward SUVs.

"(Jan 2, 2017  4:53 AM) One of the most violent years in Chicago history ended with a sobering tally: 762 homicides, the most in two decades in the city and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents last year than it did in 2015, according to data released Sunday by the Chicago Police Department. The statistics underline a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers are staggering, even for those who followed the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings, the AP reports. The increase in homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference Sunday that anger at police, including in the wake of video released that showed a white Chicago officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, has left criminals  emboldened  to violent crimes. He also said it's becoming clearer to criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system.  In Chicago, we just don't have a deterrent to pick up a gun,  he said.

"(Aug 20, 2015  11:58 AM CDT) Things continue to deteriorate in Yemen as the conflict between Houthi rebels and pro-government forces grinds on. But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a  perfect storm  of  lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply.  In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls  food insecure  people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from  moderate  malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected.  The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time,  Cousin says.  We must act now before it is too late.  Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that  the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible,  per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with  extreme  food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida.

Police in Logan City say Alex Whipple, the girl's 21-year-old uncle, is the main suspect, but he isn't cooperating with authorities, ABC reports.  We know he was with her,  says Capt. Tyson Budge. Whipple, whose sister is Elizabeth's mother, arrived at the mother's home Friday night and was going to stay the night, the Herald Journal reports. The mother told police that Whipple and her daughter were both gone when she woke up on Saturday morning. The girl was reported missing around 10am. Police say they detained Whipple after finding him walking around town at 3pm Saturday.  We're very concerned,  Budge tells the Salt Lake Tribune.  At this point, we believe she's been harmed.  Whipple hasn't been charged in his niece's disappearance yet, but he is being held on charges including absconding probation and receiving stolen property, with bail set at $250,000. Police say Elizabeth, who is about 3 feet, 6 inches tall, was wearing either blue jeans or a teal-colored plaid skirt when she was last seen.

"(Feb 2, 2015  12:48 PM) You can't exactly call it a reunion—the four surviving original Magna Cartas had never before been in the same place. So instead, the British Library called it a  unification event  today when the priceless documents were put on display together for the first time. The event marks the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, which established the timeless principle that no individual, even a monarch, is above the law. The original Magna Carta manuscripts were written and sealed in late June and early July 1215, then sent individually throughout England, making today's unification unique.  It's a real moment in history,  says Julian Harrison, the library's curator of medieval manuscripts.  Magna Carta has significance not just in England but worldwide. Many people regard it as the foundation of the rule of law. It established key principles [that] have resonated worldwide.  In 1215, 40 rebellious barons came together to declare their rights to King John, and he reluctantly consented to their demands to try to avoid civil war. The Magna Carta included acknowledgments that taxes can't be arbitrary and that free men can't be imprisoned without first being judged by peers or the law. Within weeks, the pope voided the agreement, and England was thrown into war (the document was later incorporated into English law). Officials said the unification will give the public, as well as scholars and medieval manuscript experts, a chance to scrutinize and compare the documents. Some 1,215 people—randomly selected from more than 43,000 applicants from more than 20 countries—will get to see the Magna Cartas tomorrow. Two of the documents were already housed at the library; the other two will return to their homes in the Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals after the three-day event.",4 Magna Cartas Never in Same Place—Until Now,____ Magna Cartas Never in Same Place—Until Now,4,Trans( four ),1

Experts think that the true number of people fleeing Afghanistan is much higher because of a large smuggling market that has developed. With people paying a few hundred dollars to get into Iran or Pakistan, to more than $25,000 for false papers and a flight to a country like England or Sweden, the human smuggling business in Afghanistan and Pakistan is worth more than $1 billion a year, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.",Afghan Asylum Seekers Reach 10-Year High,Afghan Asylum Seekers Reach ____-Year High,10,Trans( ten ),1

The US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio says that Elizabeth Lecron, 24, was sentenced this week to 15 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to terrorism charges in August. She had planned an attack with her boyfriend, Vincent Armstrong, on an unnamed Toledo bar, as well as purchased black powder and hundreds of screws to make bombs to destroy a Georgia pipeline. Per two USAO releases, Lecron and Armstrong started dating in mid-2018, and the two soon became  immersed  in an online extremist group called  True Crime Community,  which obsessed over mass murders  and posted extremely graphic images, videos, and sayings.  The USAO says the couple started planning the Toledo attack, which they called  D-Day ; in a June 2018 journal entry, Lecron wrote,  D-Day will be my salvation.  Lecron also became pen pals with Charleston gunman Dylann Roof, writing  numerous letters  to him in prison. In addition to the weapons, ammo, and pipe bomb materials the two purchased, they also bought clothing to wear while carrying out the attacks, investigators say. Per WTVG, Armstrong picked up a trench coat and a T-shirt that said  Society Failed Us,  while Lecron bought combat boots she thought wouldn't slip on blood and a T-shirt that said  False Prophet.  Armstrong also pleaded guilty in August to terrorism charges and will be sentenced on Dec. 10. After Lecron gets out of prison, she'll be subject to lifetime supervision, per Judge James G.

A mob infuriated by the deaths beat the driver severely and set fire to coaches, officials say. Dinesh Chandra Yadav, a local member of parliament, says the pilgrims were crossing the tracks of the packed, chaotic station in the small town of Dhamara Ghat, in Bihar state, when they were struck by the Rajya Rani Express train. Several other people were injured. Railway official Arunendra Kumar says the train was not supposed to halt at the station and had been given clearance to pass through, but some pilgrims waited on the tracks thinking they could stop the train, he says. The train stopped a few hundred yards beyond the spot where it hit the pilgrims. Angry mobs then pulled out the train driver and beat him—Yadav says the driver was killed, but Kumar says he's in hospital in critical condition. The mob then got all the passengers out of the train and set some coaches on fire. Groups of young men also smashed the windows of two other trains that were in the station. A crowd of around 5,000 people gathered near the station and were chasing away the district officials who tried to remove the bodies from the tracks.

However, Robert Schroeder, interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department, said demonstrators  crossed several intersections, creating dangerous situations as traffic continued to try to make its way in the area.  At one point, police told protesters it was illegal to block a road, to which a protester responded,  It's illegal to murder,  per USA Today. Those who did not stay on the sidewalk were ultimately arrested, Schroeder said. Hundreds of people, including some from Florida, Michigan, and New York, took part in the march.

The unidentified adult becomes the second person to die from the infamous disease this year. A 16-year-old star baseball player died of the plague in June. Both victims likely had a rare septicemic form of the plague, which is hard to diagnose because it doesn't include the typical swelling of lymph nodes seen in most plague cases. Cases of the plague are rare in the United States, and deaths are even rarer. On average, seven human plague cases are reported in the United States every year, but Colorado had eight plague cases of its own last year. Officials are attributing that to a boom in the animal population. In septicemic plague, the bacteria enters the blood stream and creates flu-like symptoms.

The record rise—which, contrary to some predictions, even the recession couldn’t curb—means that hopes of keeping global warming to a safe level is nearly out of reach, the Guardian reports in an exclusive. The paper had previously reported that in order to prevent potentially  dangerous climate change,  we must keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. But the IEA's chief economist now says that idea is just  a nice Utopia.  The IEA estimates that 30.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide entered the atmosphere last year, most of it from burning fossil fuel. That’s a rise of 1.6 gigatonnes over 2009's figure.  I am very worried. This is the worst news on emissions,  says the economist for the IEA, which has calculated that annual emissions must remain below 32 gigatonnes annually through 2020 if we're to escape global warming's worst effects. Another expert warns that if the pattern continues, there will be  a 50% chance of a rise in global average temperature of more than 4C by 2100,  which would lead to  widespread mass migration and conflict.

The government had been seeking damages under the False Claims Act because the disgraced cyclist used performance-enhancing drugs while his team was sponsored by the US Postal Service, CNN reports. The service paid $31 million to sponsor the team between 2001 and 2004.  No one is above the law,  Chad Readler at the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement.  A competitor who intentionally uses illegal PEDs not only deceives fellow competitors and fans, but also sponsors, who help make sporting competitions possible. This settlement demonstrates that those who cheat the government will be held accountable.  A civil trial had been set to begin May 7 in the case, the Washington Post reports. Armstrong—who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after admitting doping—will also have to pay $1.65 million to cover the legal costs of whistleblower Floyd Landis, the former teammate who filed the original complaint. Landis will also receive $1.1 million from the settlement. Armstrong recently listed his Austin home for sale at $7.5 million. Before the settlement, Landis, who was stripped of his own Tour de France title for doping, told the Atlantic he didn't care about the money.

He decided that the girl's mother, who was present at the time, didn't encourage her daughter's risky behavior, and that she played no  active role  in the incident, the New York Times reports.

And so there's now a plan in place, with the help of next-door neighbor Chile, to wipe out a population that's grown to 100,000 thanks to a lack of natural predators. Scientists explain that in North America, trees can often withstand beaver gnawing, but South American trees tend to die off.

We are talking about trees that are 100 or 150 years old, and they do not grow back,  the region's conservation chief says, per Phys.org. Another major issue is that dams that the beavers build produce bogs that stifle trees from growing.

Once caught, the beavers would then be  quickly  clubbed to death on the head. The project could take 10 to 15 years, experts say.

"(Dec 8, 2014  4:46 PM) A private jet that crashed into a house in Maryland today not only killed its three passengers but took the lives of a woman and her two sons living inside, WJLA reports. The woman, 36-year-old Marie Gemmell—who posted on Facebook today that she just wanted to stay home with her kids, NBC Washington notes—apparently found refuge in a second-floor bathroom with her month-old infant and three-year-old. Officials say they may have died of smoke inhalation from a fire sparked by the crash. Her husband, who was visibly upset at the scene, and their 5-year-old child weren't home when the plane came in low and almost completely blew out the first floor of the house, the AP reports.  He was trying to pull up; he would gain a little elevation and then drop again,  says an eyewitness of the pilot and plane owner, Michael Rosenberg.  And that's when it appeared to have made a dive down into the neighborhood.  Air traffic employees had talked about the number of birds near the airport just before Rosenberg fell off the radar screen, NBC Washington notes,  but it's too early in the investigation to blame a bird strike.  Rosenberg, the CEO of a biopharma corporation, had survived a crash into nearby trees four years ago that totalled his $1.4 million turbo-prop plane. The NTSB blamed him for it, saying he failed  to maintain aircraft control while performing a go-around.  His family says they are  in shock  and  devastated  to learn that others died in today's accident.","Mom, 2 Sons Also Died When Plane Destroyed House","Mom, ____ Sons Also Died When Plane Destroyed House",2,Trans( two ),1

"(Aug 10, 2008  3:38 PM CDT) Author Susan Squire takes a long view of marriage—about 5,000 years, in fact. Her new book, I Don’t: A Contrarian History of Marriage, traces matrimony’s bizarre historical journey, from pure mating ritual to Christian  lust-containment facility  to modern romance. In an interview with Salon, she says that love had nothing to do with marriage until Martin Luther said it did. In early Christianity, loving one’s wife—or any woman—was  heresy to the church,  Squire says. But codes of conduct for adultery—aka courtly love—elevated commitment to a love object, and in the 16th century, Luther called marriage a holy state of being. Modern husbands and wives may rely overly on romance and sex, but can also be credited with a new marital notion: equality.  We have tried to invert roles that have been set in stone for 4,700 years,  says Squire.  It's going to take a while.","How 5,000 Years of Marriage Led Us to 'I Do'",How ____ Years of Marriage Led Us to 'I Do',"5,000","Copy( 5,000 )",0

First notices of default were sent out on 77,733 houses, a 10% jump from the month before. The numbers  show strong signs that foreclosure activity is coming out of the rain delay we've been in for the past year  following the robo-signing scandal, RealtyTrac’s CEO explained, according to the LA Times. That’s bad news for anyone trying to sell a house, because the glut of foreclosed homes will likely drag prices down further. California was especially hard-hit, with four of its inland metro areas taking the top four spots in the most-foreclosed-upon list.

"(Apr 18, 2020  5:30 AM CDT) Hospitals in Japan are increasingly turning away sick people as the country struggles with surging coronavirus infections and its emergency medical system collapses. In one recent case, an ambulance carrying a man with a fever and difficulty breathing was rejected by 80 hospitals and forced to search for hours for a hospital in downtown Tokyo that would treat him, per the AP. Another feverish man finally reached a hospital after paramedics unsuccessfully contacted 40 clinics. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine say many hospital ERs are refusing to treat people, including those suffering strokes, heart attacks, and external injuries. Japan initially seemed to have controlled the outbreak by going after clusters of infections in specific places, usually enclosed spaces such as clubs, gyms, and meeting venues. But the spread of virus outpaced this approach, and most new cases are untraceable. The outbreak has highlighted underlying weaknesses in medical care in Japan, which has long been praised for its high-quality insurance system and reasonable costs. Apart from a general unwillingness to embrace social distancing, experts fault government incompetence and a widespread shortage of the protective gear and equipment medical workers need to do their jobs. The  collapse of emergency medicine  has already happened, a precursor to the overall collapse of medicine, the JAAM and the JSEM said in a joint statement. Tokyo's new cases started to spike in late March. They've been rising at an accelerating pace, for a current total of 2,595.  From the medical field, we are hearing cries of desperation that lives that can be saved may no longer be possible,  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday.

"(Jan 30, 2019  7:12 PM) More than a year and a half later, there are still more questions than answers in the death of Isabella Hellmann, the Miami Herald reports. The 41-year-old and her husband, Lewis Bennett, set out from their South Florida home on a sailing honeymoon, but on their way back to Florida on May 15, 2017, Hellmann disappeared and the boat sank. Bennett long denied any culpability, but in November pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in her death; her body was never found. But at a sentencing hearing Tuesday in Miami, the 41-year-old continued to insist he did not intentionally kill his wife and sink the catamaran to cover up her murder, as prosecutors initially charged him with; his sentencing was ultimately delayed until May due to unresolved issues regarding Hellmann's estate, the Miami Herald reports.  What happened that night with my girl?  Hellman's mother, in Spanish, asked the judge at Tuesday's hearing (Hellmann was a US citizen; her family is from Colombia).  He needs to say what happened,  added Hellman's sister.  She disappeared and that’s it. What happened to her?  All Bennett, who holds dual citizenship from Australia as well as his native Britain, has said is that the boat ran into trouble overnight while Hellman was on watch; a loud noise woke him up and he came above deck to find her gone. He admitted she was not a strong swimmer or sailor yet he did not require her to wear a life jacket or harness, and that he didn't do much to search for her. At Tuesday's hearing, he apologized to her family for his  poor decisions,  the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The couple's only child, a 2-year-old girl, lives with Bennett's parents in Scotland, and Hellmann's family is at odds with them over visitation rights.

Starting at midnight tonight and continuing through 4am Monday, the bridge will be closed to cars so that a movable median barrier can be installed along the 1.7-mile span to prevent head-on collisions, the AP reports. It's said to be the iconic bridge's longest shutdown ever and the first closure since the few hours it took off in 1987 for its 50th-anniversary celebration. Golden Gate Transit buses, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and bicyclists will still be allowed, but officials suggest skipping a city visit if possible.  Stay at home,  a bridge district spokeswoman tells the San Francisco Chronicle. About 80,000 drivers cross into San Francisco over the Golden Gate on a typical weekend day, so if all those commuters decide to join the 60,000 drivers who use the nearby Richmond-San Rafael Bridge,  it's going to be a mess,  says the bridge official. The $30 million concrete barrier will take the place of yellow plastic markers currently hand-placed by bridge workers to separate traffic going in opposite directions. Crews will be able to move the new barrier using two special  zipper trucks  to rework the bridge's six lanes as needed, depending on traffic. Officials hope the new system will cut down on head-on crashes: There have been 128 of them on the bridge, resulting in 16 deaths, since 1970, reports AP.

He fired a shotgun at the more than 100 students in Geology 104, then shot and wounded the instructor with a handgun, and then shot himself. One of the victims, Daniel Parmentier, was shot in the head while sitting in the front row of the auditorium; his girlfriend, sitting next to him, was also killed.

In what the News Tribune calls  one of the most heartbreaking  cases in the history of Tacoma, Wash., 60-year-old Robert D. Washburn was arrested Thursday and charged with the murder of 13-year-old Jennifer Bastian, who disappeared during a bike ride in a local park on Aug. 4, 1986. Jennifer's body was found more than three weeks later in what KOMO describes as a  remote area  of Point Defiance Park, and evidence showed she'd been sexually assaulted and strangled. The case soon went cold—until DNA evidence that emerged in 2013 took investigators in a new direction. Even though DNA retrieved from Jennifer's bathing suit didn't initially find a match in national and state registries, there were 2,300 names listed in Jennifer's case paperwork—and investigators decided to ask those who didn't have DNA on file to voluntarily submit to testing. Washburn—who'd once called in a tip on Welch's case and had since moved to Illinois—was one of those names, and in March 2017 he submitted a sample; a match was made and he was arrested in Eureka.

Agents arrested Yaser Abdel Said, 63, in Justin, some 36 miles northwest of Dallas. The Egyptian-born suspect had been sought on a capital murder warrant since the New Year's Day 2008 fatal shootings of the two Lewisville High School students, Sarah Yaser Said, 17, and Amina Yaser Said, 18, the AP reports. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2014. A police report says a family member told investigators that the suspect threatened  bodily harm  against Sarah for going on a date with a non-Muslim. The mother, Patricia Said, fled with her daughters in the week before their deaths because she was in  great fear for her life.  Gail Gattrell, the sisters’ great-aunt, has called the deaths an  honor killing,  in which a woman is murdered by a relative to protect her family’s honor. The teenage sisters were found shot multiple times in a cab outside a motel in Irving, a Dallas suburb. Police found them after one of the girls called 911 from a cellphone and said she was dying.  Help,  said a crying voice on the 911 recording, later determined by police to be that of Sarah Said.  I’m dying. Oh my God. Stop it.  Police could not immediately find the teens after the 7:33pm call. Much of what Sarah said in the recording was unintelligible, and the dispatcher’s repeated requests for her to provide an address went unanswered. An emergency dispatcher received another call about an hour later from the motel after someone spotted the bodies.

Yesterday, he told his 120 employees at Gravity Payments in Seattle that over the next three years, he'll gradually raise salaries until everyone in the company is making at least $70,000. It wasn't just the article that convinced him to make his move: He spoke to friends who  walk[ed] me through the math of making 40 grand a year,  he tells the New York Times, and what they said about rent increases and credit card debt  just eats at me inside.  He wanted to put his plan into action without an increase in price or a decrease in service for his customers, so he plans to pay for the salary increases by using up 75% to 80% of the company's profits this year—and by cutting his own salary from almost $1 million to, yes, $70,000. And there it will stay until the company gets back to the same level of profit it had before he made this change, he says. Currently, the average salary at Gravity Payments, which Price founded in 2004 as a 19-year-old Seattle Pacific University student, is $48,000; as part of Price's plan, about 70 employees will see their wages increase—30 will actually see their wages double.

Though just 75% of the initial 23,000-square-mile search zone has been scoured, a statement today says the area has now expanded to 46,000 square miles—about the size of Pennsylvania—in the southern Indian Ocean, NBC News reports.  The search into the expanded area has already commenced, with search efforts focused in the south to take advantage of the last of the usable weather in that area,  the Australian Transport Safety Bureau says. As winter weather in the area will make the search difficult,  the search plan has been modified to enable continuous search operations during winter and to ensure that the entire area is searched as quickly and effectively as possible.  The new search area, based on satellite data and pings from the plane, offers the  highest probability  of finding the Boeing 777, officials say.  Beyond that, it is not possible to refine the search area to one of greater likelihood.  Search crews received a boost of confidence with the discovery of a shipwreck last week because it meant their technology was working, Popular Mechanics reports. However, the robot crucial to that find will be shelved until weather improves, meaning the search could slow.

Findings from the gravesites can be used as evidence of the group's crimes, they said. The graves date from 2014 to 2017, when the militant group ruled some of Iraq's largest cities and towns. As the militants swept through Iraq and neighboring Syria, they killed captured members of the security forces en masse, expelled or killed minorities, and enslaved women from the Yazidi sect.

"(Jun 14, 2014  6:52 AM CDT) The planet we're living on is about 60 million years older than previously thought. So say scientists in France who studied quartz from Australia and South Africa that dates back about 3 billion years, reports Phys.org. The ratio of gases in the quartz compared to today's ratios suggest both the Earth and the moon were created about 40 million years after the formation of the solar system, rather than the previous estimate of 100 million years afterward. That's likely when a collision happened that left behind Earth as we know it—and formed the moon, the Huffington Post explains. At that time, experts think, an object the size of Mars smashed into the predecessor of our planet, the Los Angeles Times reports. That collision created Earth's atmosphere, while the resulting debris formed the moon.  The gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of 'time capsule,'  says a scientist from the University of Lorraine.  We are using standard methods to compute the age of the Earth, but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data.

"(Oct 25, 2017  6:03 AM CDT) You really can put a price on happiness, or at least Albert Einstein's pithy theory on the matter: The theory, scribbled on a piece of paper and handed to a messenger, sold at auction for $1.56 million, AFP reports. The record-setting bid at Tuesday's sale in Jerusalem far surpassed estimates of $5,000 to $8,000, per Winner's auction house. Einstein scrawled the note on Imperial Hotel Tokyo stationery in 1922 while on a tour of Japan after being informed he'd won the Nobel Prize for physics. It reads in German:  A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it,  per the BBC. The physicist better known for another theory gave the note to a courier who made a delivery to his room. Einstein didn't want the man to leave empty-handed, so instead of a tip he handed him two notes, the anonymous seller tells AFP. The second missive, which sold for $240,000, was less original.  Where there’s a will, there’s a way,  it reads.  Maybe if you’re lucky those notes will become much more valuable than just a regular tip,  Einstein told the man, says the seller, a relative of the courier who lives in Hamburg, Germany. The auction house says the buyer was a European who wants to remain anonymous, per the BBC. Two other letters Einstein wrote later were also auctioned, fetching prices of $33,600 and $9,600, per AFP. Other Einstein letters about God, Israel, and physics sold for almost $210,000 in June. (These US cities are the happiest.)",Einstein 'Tipped' the Man With a Note.

It was all a sting set up by federal agents, however. The indictment described 48-year-old Joseph Hunter, also known as  Rambo,  as a contract killer and leader of the group of ex-snipers. Hunter, now a resident of Thailand, was to appear in court in New York City tomorrow. According to the court papers, undercover operators promised Hunter in March that his security team would be protecting thousands of kilos of marijuana and would be seeing  tons of cocaine and millions of dollars.  Audio and video recordings of the meeting show Hunter discussing  bonus jobs  of contract killings, saying the men he had recruited want to do as much  bonus  work as possible, the indictment said. When assassinations of a federal agent and an informant were proposed, Hunter  didn't flinch at the chance,  says US Attorney Preet Bharara. Hunter boasted that his men could handle both jobs.

"(Aug 27, 2017  3:00 PM CDT) Tobe Hooper, the horror-movie pioneer whose low-budget sensation The Texas Chain Saw Massacre took a buzz saw to audiences with its brutally frightful vision, has died. He was 74. The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Sunday said Hooper died Saturday in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. It was reported as a natural death. Along with contemporaries like George Romero and John Carpenter, Hooper crafted some of the scariest nightmares that ever haunted moviegoers, the AP reports. Hooper directed 1982's Poltergeist from a script by Steven Spielberg, and helmed the well-regarded 1979 miniseries Salem's Lot, from Stephen King's novel. Hooper was a little-known filmmaker of documentaries and TV commercials when he made his most famous work: 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He made it for less than $300,000 in his native Texas, and yet it became one the most influential films in horror: a slasher film landmark.  I had never seen anything like it and I wanted to see it myself,  said Hooper in 2014. The film was controversial. Several countries banned it, though the independent film — aided by its gory reputation and lightning fast word-of-mouth — grossed $30.8 million, playing for eight years in drive-ins and theaters. Halloween director John Carpenter on Sunday called it  a seminal work in horror cinema,  while William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, recalled Hooper as  a kind, warm-hearted man who made the most terrifying film ever.

Keisha Richburg was investigated after Jamel Harris was shot in the head June 19, CBS 46 reports. A passerby, Leilani Collier, found Harris lying in the street and stopped to help; she looked in his wallet to find his ID, and later turned the wallet—which had the $500 cash in it—over to police. Collier told Harris' widow about the money, but when police gave Lanique Harris the wallet, they told her there was no money in it, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

An administrative investigation was not able to determine what happened to the cash, but Officer Richburg did not properly account for the money according to the department's policies and procedures,  says a statement from the police department.  As a result, she was terminated.  Adds Police Chief Erika Shields,  Officer integrity goes to the heart of what we do here every single day.

But the 20-something singer, whose star turn showed her stripped down to her skivvies and provocatively eating fruit, lives in Egypt, and the conservative powers-that-be there have sentenced her to prison, the BBC reports. Shyma (real name: Shaimaa Ahmed) was arrested in November, and on Tuesday she was handed a two-year sentence on charges of debauchery and publishing an indecent film, per local media. The New York Daily News says Mohamed Gamal, the director of the video, called  I Have Issues,  was also sentenced to two years in prison in absentia. The Telegraph offers more details, explaining that in the video, Shyma appears in her underwear, then noshes on a milk-drizzled banana, licks an apple, and samples cake icing in front of a classroom of beguiled men. The video got her more than 1 million followers, but then came her arrest. The debauchery charge isn't an uncommon one in Egypt, with media reports citing instances of women being thrown behind bars for dancing in music videos (that recently earned belly dancers six months each in prison) and, in the case of a singer who proclaimed on film that sipping Nile River water could get people sick,  spreading provocative publicity.  As for Shyma, she noted before her arrest in a Facebook post that's since disappeared that she was sorry for her  inappropriate  behavior and  didn't imagine ... that I would be subjected to such a strong attack from everyone.

That doesn't include those who used to the site to find out if they qualify for Medicaid, or those who used state-based enrollment websites. A new report estimates another 49,000 have enrolled through the latter.

Now their nightmare has doubled: Darryl's 18-year-old brother, Ryan, was killed by a hit-and-run driver over the weekend near the college where he was a freshman, the Detroit News reports. Ryan and Darryl were Paul and Julie Tsatsos' only children, the paper notes.  No arrests have been made yet in the death of Ryan Tsatsos,  a Michigan State Police rep said Monday.  We are following up on tips. We are aware that the family lost their other son three months ago. This is a terribly tragic situation.  Their ongoing nightmare started in the early hours of July 26, after a deputy tried to pull Darryl over for speeding, the News reports. Even though the officer eventually gave up the chase, a few minutes later he came upon an accident scene, where Darryl's car had slammed into two other vehicles, killing Darryl (the other drivers weren't seriously injured). In Ryan's case, he was walking with friends early Sunday near Central Michigan University when a car plowed into him going as fast as 80mph, throwing him 30 feet into a ditch, WJBK reports.

I've recycled 200,000 cans and bottles,  Ryan Hickman tells ABC7. He got  hooked  on recycling at age 3 after a visit to a recycling center.  He really loved the actual act of putting all the cans and bottles into the machine and getting the money for it,  his father says. Ryan then started asking friends and neighbors to save their recyclables for him. Today, he runs Ryan's Recycling out of San Juan Capistrano with customers across Orange County, according to his website. With help from family members, Ryan picks up and sorts plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans and cleans out  yucky liquids  to prepare them for recycling. His parents then take the recyclables to a recycling center.  The recycling money I'm saving for a garbage truck,  says Ryan, who was also gifted $10,000 and a miniature recycling truck on a recent appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, per the Capistrano Dispatch. But his parents stress that the money is actually being set aside for his education. Not all of the money coming in is being kept for Ryan, though. He also sells T-shirts with proceeds donated to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach  for the sea lions to get food and medicine,  Ryan says. His advice:  If you don't recycle, start recycling —and the reason is simple.  It helps the world,  Ryan tells the Dispatch.

In 1956, publisher William M. Gaines put Feldstein in charge of the magazine, which gleefully parodied politicians and mocked traditional morality. Feldstein and Gaines assembled a pool of artists and writers who turned out such enduring features as  Spy vs. Spy,  ''The Lighter Side of...  and  Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.  Building on a character used by Mad founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Feldstein turned the freckle-faced Alfred E. Neuman into an underground hero—a dimwitted everyman with a gap-toothed smile and the recurring stock phrase,  What, Me Worry?  Under Gaines and Feldstein, Mad's sales flourished, topping 2 million in the early 1970s. In a 1997 interview with the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Feldstein credited Mad's challenges to authority with helping incite the cultural revolution of the 1960s.  Who's covering up? That was one of our slogans,  he said.  We were orienting them to the adult world.

Rolling Stone reports that an attendee/survivor has filed a $100 million class-action lawsuit against festival creators Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, aka Jeffrey Atkins. The complaint ticks off a by-now familiar litany of complaints about the supposedly luxurious getaway in the Bahamas that saw everything that could go wrong do so in spectacular fashion. And one big problem for McFarland and Ja Rule is that their well-heeled clientele can afford big-name lawyers.

"(Feb 21, 2020  4:30 PM) Wells Fargo agreed Friday to pay the government $3 billion to settle investigations into a series of abuses that went on for years, including opening accounts for customers without their approval. The deal wraps up federal civil and criminal cases, the Wall Street Journal reports, though criminal charges could be pursued if the bank doesn't stick to its agreement, which includes cooperating with investigations for another three years. Wells Fargo makes a series of admissions in the settlement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, per the Washington Post. The bank admits to taking millions of dollars in fees through the falsification of records and forging of signatures by thousands of its employees. Personal data of customers was  unlawfully misused,  the agreement says, to help the bank reach sales goals—and sometimes to keep the customers from learning about the unauthorized accounts.  This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within  the bank, said Nick Hanna, US attorney for central California.  Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way.  The fine equals about 15% of the bank's profits last year. Wells Fargo is still one of the nation's largest and most profitable banks, but it has been in decline since the scandals surfaced in 2016. It still has issues with regulators; the Federal Reserve has slapped a cap on the bank's growth. Prosecutors said top executives knew of the abuses as far back as 2002. An internal investigation said Wells Fargo's decentralized management structure made it possible for the bosses to avoid doing anything about them.

He wrote it over the course of nearly two years spent at Dachau, a feat managed in part because of the job he was assigned as an office manager at a screw factory, which  provided him clandestine opportunities to keep a secret diary,  writes David Chrisinger for the New York Times Magazine, which highlights the diary as part of a series telling  lesser-known stories  from World War II. Kupfer-Koberwitz documented everything he could about the horrors of  a satanic world  in the diary, which he hid from guards in a wooden box with a false bottom. Once it was too large for even the box, he and a co-worker dug a hole in the factory's concrete floor in October 1944 and buried it, digging it out a week after Dachau was liberated. It is one of only a small number of surviving testimonies to have been written inside a German concentration camp. Most of those that do exist are in pieces and  almost none show Edgar's extraordinary powers of observation,  per Chrisinger. And  no detail was too small or too cruel for him to preserve.  It describes, for instance, the use of a torture device in which victims were hung  from the arms that are twisted backward,  per the Knoxville Daily Sun.  These are the torments of hell!

"(May 20, 2013  9:46 AM CDT) Talk about a road trip: Russian explorers spent the past two-and-a-half months driving from Russia to Canada via the North Pole. But instead of car bingo and the alphabet game, they passed their time clearing the route with a pickaxe, gazing upon the aurora borealis, and spotting the occasional polar bear. The 2,485-mile journey from Russian archipelago Severnaya Zemlya to Resolute Bay in Canada's far north took 70 days at a speed of about 6.2mph—about farm-tractor speed, PhysOrg reports. The team flew back to Russia on Thursday, leaving their vehicles in a garage; they'll be driven back to Russia across the Bering Straight next February. Speaking of those vehicles, they're pretty bizarre: CBC describes them as  amphibious trucks,  while PhysOrg calls them  buses with bloated tires.  They were able to carry the explorers over drifting ice floes and would have kept them afloat, had they fallen into the Arctic Ocean (which they almost did at one point).

The Wall Street Journal reports the three have been given five days to exit the country. The offending opinion piece was headlined  China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia,  and the uproar from the foreign ministry and state-media outlets came quickly. A ministry rep on Wednesday said  the Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks.  He demanded a public apology and said the paper must  punish those responsible,  reports the New York Times. CNN reports it marks the first time since 1989 that multiple foreign journalists have been expelled at the same time, and the first expulsion of a foreign correspondent in general in 22 years. The three are Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen; all work in news, which has no interaction with the paper's opinion operation. As for the offending phrase in the headline of the piece, which was written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead and touched on the coronavirus epidemic, the Journal reports it  was used by both outsiders and Chinese intellectuals to refer to a weakened China’s exploitation by European powers and Japan in the late 1800s and early 1900s.",China's Retaliation Against WSJ a First Since 1989,China's Retaliation Against WSJ a First Since ____,1989,Copy( 1989 ),0

"(Apr 13, 2015  11:09 AM CDT) Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine out of 10 adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released today. As recently as 2013, slightly more than eight out of 10 had coverage. Whether the new number from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index turns out to be a high-water mark for President Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all US residents covered, remains to be seen. The law's future is still up in the air and will hinge on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The Gallup-Healthways survey found that the share of adults who lack insurance dropped to 11.9% for the first three months of this year, the lowest level since that survey began its tracking in 2008. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got underway, according to Gallup.  The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,  says the research director for the poll.  The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.  On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since fall 2013, when the first open enrollment was about to begin, according to Gallup.",Almost 90% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance,Almost ____% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance,90,"Multiply( 100 , Divide( Trans( nine ) , 10 ) )",1

"(Dec 19, 2017  2:40 PM) A 92-year-old hunter in Virginia had to spend a frigid night in the woods, but he's safe now thanks to quick work by a drone. Bill McDonnell went out hunting Saturday in Shenandoah County, and his family notified authorities when he hadn't emerged from the woods by that evening, reports the Washington Post. Rescuers had a general sense of where he was thanks to a phone call he'd made to his family, but a search involving helicopters and foot patrols proved fruitless through the night. Enter the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, whose search-and-rescue team arrived on the scene Sunday morning, dispatched a relatively new drone at 9:30am, and located McDonnell a mere 20 minutes later. Rescuers on foot then found him and escorted him back to safety, and he's fine.  All of a sudden it got dark on me,  he explains.  I couldn’t see my hands in front of my face. I couldn't go forwards, I couldn't go backwards, I couldn't go left, I couldn't go right or any place. It was worse than the jungle.  As WJLA notes, McDonnell is a World War II vet who spent his share of nights sleeping outside during the war. Temperatures dipped into the 20s Saturday night, but McDonnell had dressed warmly, packed food, and made himself a bed in twigs and leaves. He adds that his son made him promise not to go hunting alone anymore. The Post provides another nugget: The drone is just the sixth in the nation that flies in the Project Lifesaver program—it has a special antenna designed to locate people with medical conditions such as Alzheimer's who are wearing a specific wristband. In this case, however, McDonnell wasn't a participant in that program.

TMZ reports he was found dead in his tour bus outside the venue and that it's possible he overdosed. The Guardian reports that shortly before his death, the rapper posted a video to Instagram talking about taking six Xanax. In a statement, First Access Entertainment CEO Sarah Stennett says she is  shocked and heartbroken.  Stennett says she spoke with Ahr's mother, who asked her to convey  that she is very, very proud of him and everything he was able to achieve in his short life.

He released his debut project on SoundCloud in 2015 and went on to release mixtapes and videos that got millions of views.

"(Jan 4, 2012  7:54 AM) Scientists say there's a simple way to minimize the risk that the natural gas extraction technique known as  fracking  will cause earthquakes—like the one that hit Ohio on New Year's. But there’s a catch: It costs $10 million per injection well, a price the energy industry isn’t likely to pony up gladly, Reuters reports. It's not the actual fracking, but the disposal of contaminated fluids—which are typically pumped deep into the Earth—that seems to be causing the quakes. So seismologists say that if companies conducted a thorough seismic survey before pumping drilling fluid into the ground, they could make sure it’s not going to hit quake-prone areas. But the process is both more costly and more involved than the oil companies’ usual method of drilling a bore hole to collect a limited rock sample, and companies aren’t likely to do more until the link between fracking and earthquakes is definitively proven. It hasn’t been yet, but the evidence is strong: Every region where fracking has taken off has seen quakes increase tenfold.",Fracking Quakes Could Be Avoided ... for $10M Per Well,Fracking Quakes Could Be Avoided ... for $____M Per Well,10,Copy( 10 ),0

The plane's right wing broke off in the crash landing,  causing the fuselage to cartwheel in a fiery ball,  tells the Sioux City Journal. Still, nearly 200 people lived. Haynes, who served as a Marine aviator before joining United Airlines in 1956, later acknowledged  it should have been a non-survivable crash,  per the Register. Indeed, no pilot could maintain control of the plane when the incident was recreated in flight simulators, reports CNN. But Haynes always emphasized the team effort.  He was the most humble man I've ever met in my life,  says Gary Brown, emergency management director in Woodbury County at the time of the crash. Haynes retired in 1991 but  worked tirelessly over the next three decades to help prevent future air disasters,  per the Journal.  His legacy will endure,  United Airlines says in a statement.

"(Oct 7, 2018  2:30 PM CDT) A rare condition known for its polio-like effects has been diagnosed in six Minnesota children since mid-September. Per CNN, the condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and damages the body's nervous system. While uncommon, AFM is serious and can lead to paralysis or even death. The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the Star-Tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, AFM's more elusive cause means there is no vaccine.  Disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases,  the Minnesota Department of Public Health said in a statement.  The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information.  AFM most commonly affects young children and the cases in Minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. AFM is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of AFM, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren't permanent. (Meanwhile, the CDC says the disease may be on the rise.)",Rare Polio-Like Illness Strikes 6 Minnesota Children,Rare Polio-Like Illness Strikes ____ Minnesota Children,6,Trans( six ),1

Cholo Abdi Abdullah  obtained pilot training in the Philippines in preparation for seeking to hijack a commercial aircraft and crash it into a building in the United States,  according to a newly unsealed federal indictment. Abdullah was arrested last year in the Philippines, where he had spent years training as a pilot and completed the necessary tests for a pilot's license, the New York Times reports. Prosecutors say the 30-year-old was taking orders from a commander in al-Shabab, a group that has sworn allegiance to al-Qaeda. Abdullah allegedly researched aircraft security issues including methods of hijacking a plane, information on the tallest building in an unnamed major US city, and how to obtain a US visa. After his July 2019 arrest, Philippine authorities said Abdullah had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2012. They said firearms and explosives were found at his residence. Abdullah was transported from the Philippines to the US Tuesday and entered a not guilty plea in a federal court in Manhattan Wednesday, NBC New York reports.

Rescuers struggled to find Patricia Rabellizsa, 29, among the vegetation, tree cover, and difficult terrain found in the area of Makawao.  Where the ziplines are, they go through the gulches, so it made it kinda difficult,  said a Maui Fire spokesman.  Where the body was—where the lady fell—we couldn't access it with the helicopters so they had to carry her off to the side.  Rabellizsa, a zipline worker, was dead on the scene.

At the time, the state auditor found no evidence of  harm or abusive practices  in the zipline business (see the report here). State Rep. Mark Nakashima, who introduced the bill, says Rabellizsa's death may be  what it takes to get interest from the legislature.

The state's highest court had ordered district attorneys in seven counties to produce lists by Tuesday indicating how many of approximately 24,000 cases involving Annie Dookhan they would be unable or unwilling to prosecute if the defendants were granted new trials. The ACLU said Tuesday night that 21,587 cases had been recommended for dismissal. It said that would be the largest dismissal of criminal convictions in US history. The cases would be formally dismissed by court action, expected Thursday, the ACLU said. Dookhan pleaded guilty in 2013 to obstruction of justice, perjury, and tampering with evidence after being accused of falsifying her work as far back as 2004. Prosecutors said Dookhan admitted testing only a fraction of a batch of samples, then listing them all as positive for illegal drugs. Her motive, they said, was to boost her productivity and burnish her reputation. She was sentenced to three years in prison and was paroled last year. Many of the drug case defendants have already completed their sentences, though some probably remain in prison because of other charges not contaminated by the lab scandal.

"(Jul 16, 2019  4:24 PM CDT) Bad welds in 2,100 new Legacy sedans and Outback SUVs have led Subaru to decide to scrap the vehicles rather than try to repair them. Most of the defective models haven't been delivered yet, but at least 20 US purchasers will have the option of having Suburu replace their new vehicle or buy it back, per NBC. The automaker said that a supplier didn't clean part of its machinery properly, which reduced the effectiveness of a welder used to join sheet metal components in cowls. Over time, the welds on the cowl, which separates the engine from the passenger compartment, could fail. That could lead to an accident, the Japanese automaker said, and make injuries to occupants more likely. A body shop employee spotted the weld problem on June 6, per the International Business Times. Subaru then launched an internal investigation. The 1,965 Outback and 142 Legacy models affected were made between May 31 and June 6.

The opposite has been the case, the Wall Street Journal finds. The memorial, which opens next month, is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million visitors a year, but the area is underserved by businesses, meaning travelers will have a hard time finding a meal or a place to stay anywhere near the site—especially if they come by the busload. The county could definitely use more jobs, but a lack of infrastructure and the weak economy are discouraging people from starting new businesses, as is a wish not to be seen to be exploiting the tragedy. Visitors  are here to pay their respects and I don't want to take advantage of people—but of course I'm hoping business improves,  says the owner of a sports bar a few miles away from the memorial.","Around Flight 93 Memorial, a Tourist Wasteland","Around Flight ____ Memorial, a Tourist Wasteland",93,Copy( 93 ),0

During its takeover of Merrill Lynch, the lawsuit charges, Bank of America told investors Merrill wouldn’t pay bonuses without BoA’s permission before the deal closed. But, the Securities and Exchange Commission holds, BofA had  contractually authorized  Merrill to pay $5.8 billion in bonuses, the Wall Street Journal adds. Companies must tell investors of activities that could affect the market.

The Tampa Tribune reports 59-year-old Florida resident Peter Sloan recently filed a lawsuit to force Shatner to stop denying his paternity, take a DNA test, and pay him $170 million in damages for defamation, libel, slander, and more.  There has been a pattern of behavior that makes me look like I am lying, and I won’t stand for that anymore,  Sloan says.  I am tired of being called a fraud by his people and him.  Sloan claims his mother hooked up with Shatner in Toronto while they were starring in the Canadian version of Howdy Doody. He says he was adopted and only learned of his famous parentage when he reconnected with his birth mother in the 1980s. Sloan claims Shatner actually admitted to being his father in 1984 during a meeting on the set of TJ Hooker, TMZ reports. Shatner denies it, and Sloan has no proof the meeting ever happened. In 2011, Sloan started using the name Peter Shatner online and for a radio show he hosts, leading to allegations from Shatner's camp—which points out that  many people over the years…have claimed to be his children —that Sloan is just after some easy fame and money, according to the New York Post. But Sloan says it's not about the money, he just wants to bond with his dad.  I am William Shatner’s son, and I just wish he would acknowledge me,  he tells the Post.

The men from Gaston County, near Charlotte, were arrested by federal authorities on Saturday after more than a month's investigation. Walter Eugene Litteral, 50, Christopher James Barker, 41, and Christopher Todd Campbell, 30, are accused of stockpiling guns and ammunition, as well as attempting to manufacture pipe bombs and live grenades from military surplus  dummy  grenades, according to unsealed criminal complaints released yesterday. The close to 60 pages of information compiled by federal authorities since July include allegations Litteral planned to makes explosives out of tennis balls covered in nails and coffee cans filled with ball bearings. According to the documents, both Litteral and Campbell spoke openly about their opposition to Jade Helm 15, a series of ongoing special forces training missions in several Southwestern states that has drawn suspicion from residents who fear it is part of a planned military takeover. The federal conspiracy charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. In addition, Campbell has been charged with a separate firearms charge punishable by 10 years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.","Feds: 3 Stockpiled Weapons, Fearing Martial Law in US","Feds: ____ Stockpiled Weapons, Fearing Martial Law in US",3,Copy( 3 ),0

According to an NPR and Pro Publica report, the organization claims to have provided 130,000 people with homes but in fact built only six permanent homes.

It started with one Romanoff Quarles, 43, of Philadelphia; he had his eye on the property of his neighbor Dorothy Kennedy, who had died with no heirs in 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Kennedy's home and car were legally supposed to go to the state, but Quarles' lawyer, Andrew Kaufman, 56, came up with  a scheme that would allow Quarles to unlawfully exploit the system,  police say.

Meanwhile, Quarles buried Kennedy, with help from a former funeral home owner as well as chapel owner Antoine Turay. Turay provided Quarles with a bill for $7,000, though the burial had actually cost $1,400; that bill served as documentation as Quarles sought to become the estate's administrator.

Scott Foster, a 36-year-old accountant who played hockey for Western Michigan University in the early to mid-2000s, was acting as the emergency back-up goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks Thursday. Foster had filled this role for about a dozen other games this season, which mostly meant enjoying free food in the United Center press box. This time would be different.

Reliable records on the stat go back to 1993. A man shot in the ankle in Brooklyn around lunchtime on Monday broke the three-day streak, but the Friday-through-Sunday record stands.  I can't remember the last time we had a weekend where we didn't have at least one shooting in the city,  says NYPD Chief Terence Monahan, who the New York Post notes has been with the department since the early '80s.

In a stunning exposé, the newspaper has uncovered that some Subway outlets in New York are serving up  footlongs  that are only 11 to 11.5 inches. The Post was first alerted to the problem by an observant eater whose picture of a sandwich next to a tape measure went viral earlier this week, and the newspaper carried out its own investigation into the matter. Four out of seven so-called  footlongs  purchased in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens came up short. Some have speculated that subs end up shorter when they're toasted, but the Post found no evidence of that. The newspaper also learned that cold-cut portion sizes have been cut by 25% recently, thanks to increased food costs, according to a franchise owner.

"(Nov 18, 2019  9:45 AM) Broken sports equipment usually turns up in the garbage, but one busted tennis racket up for auction starting Monday could end up selling for five figures. The racket that Serena Williams threw down onto the court in September 2018 during a US Open final match against Naomi Osaka is up for sale via Goldin Auctions, and while the opening bid is set at just $2,000, founder Ken Goldin thinks it'll bring in at least $10,000, and perhaps as much as $50,000, he tells the New York Times. The incident that led to the racket's untimely demise was Williams' clash with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, which, combined with a playing violation, brought her a $17,000 fine and jump-started a debate over sexism and racism in the tennis industry. The racket took a nonlinear path to Goldin. Ball boy Justin Arrington-Holmes says he got permission from Williams to keep the racket, though after a home cleaning spree, he sold it over the summer to a New York City collectibles shop for $500; a worker from that store said they subsequently sold it.  I wish I'd had someone help me with the process,  Holmes says after finding out how much the racket might go for now. This isn't the only Williams' racket that's seen auction action: Forbes notes one she smashed in 2005's Wimbledon was put up for sale last month by Nate D. Sanders Auctions; there were no bids, but it's still listed on the site for $10,000. As for this auction, Holmes won't see any of the money, but he hopes the seller donates something to charity or a youth tennis group.

"(Aug 7, 2018  2:32 PM CDT) Officials in Indonesia have reportedly found a woman who went missing as a 13-year-old in 2003—held in a cave-like space under the control of an 83-year-old shaman. The BBC reports on the allegations, which date back 15 years to when the then-teen's family took her to a man named Jago for an unspecified treatment and left her in his care. Jago allegedly told the family the girl, identified by the Jakarta Post as HS, left for Jakarta to find work later that year; they searched for her fruitlessly. But a tip led police to Galumpang in central Sulawesi, where they say they found the now-28-year-old living in what the BBC describes as a cave near Jago's home that was outfitted with a few items of furniture. The Post paints a cruder picture, framing it as a  hole  and a  crevice between several very large rocks.   We found the victim in a gap between rocks,  says a local police rep. Officials say she was too fearful to flee because of a spirit, or  jin.  The BBC reports Jago allegedly convinced her she was possessed by one; the Post describes him as telling her the hole was being guarded by one. Either way, both reports describe her as  brainwashed.  Jago is accused of raping her throughout her captivity and faces as many as 15 years in prison if convicted; further charges may be filed. In a truly bizarre twist, the Post reports police learned of HS' whereabouts from a neighbor of Jago's son—who is married to the sister of HS, who allegedly knew where her sister was and argued with her husband about it; the neighbor allegedly heard their argument and informed police.",Teen Missing Since 2003 Found in 'Gap Between Rocks',Teen Missing Since ____ Found in 'Gap Between Rocks',2003,Copy( 2003 ),0

The tech giant found that out Tuesday when, in what Bloomberg calls  the worst-kept secret in Brussels,  Europe's competition chief hit it with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine—the largest ever in this kind of case, per the New York Times. Google was fined for giving its own comparison shopping service preference over its competitors in its search results, with Vestager noting in a European Commission statement that Google  abused its market dominance as a search engine,  keeping other firms from competing and consumers overseas from benefiting from that competition. The ruling notes if the company doesn't make changes within 90 days, it risks more penalties  of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company,  which the BBC estimates could amount to $14 million a day. The Google comparison shopping product, now called  Google Shopping,  hit the EU in 2004, but even though its performance lagged, it still always fell at or near the top in Google search results, while rival services were  demoted.  Google isn't the first Silicon Valley notable to fall onto Vestager's radar: She's also gone after Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, with critics saying her efforts have been overzealous when it comes to American companies. Google, which is expected to appeal the ruling, denies it's done anything untoward, saying competition is booming (it cites Amazon and eBay as examples) and asserting it has helped boost Europe's digital economy.

Pilot Bertrand Piccard was at the controls of the single-seater Solar Impulse 2, which is making the 910-mile journey from Muscat to Ahmedabad without a drop of fuel. It will take an estimated 16 hours of flying as it crosses over the Arabian Sea to India. The aircraft's wings are covered by more than 17,000 solar cells that recharge the plane's batteries; its wingspan is 236 feet, spanning larger than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, but it weighs just 5,070 pounds, or about as much as a minivan.

Peter DeFazio (a Democrat) and Mike Coffman (a Republican) say the success of the all-volunteer force has rendered the agency moot, and that the $24 million spent annually to maintain the draft is a waste.

After grueling training regimens, they set off on Nov. 3 from the Ronne Ice Shelf, and both hope to make it to the finish line (the Ross Ice Shelf) in about two months' time, through some of the most extreme conditions and while dragging sleds that initially weighed 375 pounds each. They can't accept  so much as a cup of tea  from anyone along the way. In 2016, Rudd's friend, Henry Worsley, attempted the feat before turning back, then tragically died of organ failure after being airlifted out. English explorer Ben Saunders made the attempt last year, but he ended his quest at Mile 805. Rudd announced his plans in April, while O'Brady sprung his own surprise on the world in October, so when the men first met up in Punta Arenas, Chile,  there was a lot of tension and distrust.  But they ended up bonding as they both discovered in the other a similar drive to pull off the unprecedented feat. When they embarked, they hugged before departing, with Rudd noting:  Good luck. I think we're both going to make it.  More on their journey in the ice-covered no man's land in the Times and National Geographic, which notes that some contend this feat has already been accomplished.","In Antarctica, 2 Vie to Finish 'Impossible First'","In Antarctica, ____ Vie to Finish 'Impossible First'",2,Trans( two ),1

The New Jersey fifth grader—identified by WNEP as Hunter Pederson—was visiting his grandfather's house when he asked to see his uncle's gun collection, according to a police report. The uncle, 34-year-old Chad Olm, let his son and Hunter handle three handguns but told police he had no worries because he doesn't leave his guns loaded. The fatal moment came when Olm pulled out his Glock 27 .40-caliber handgun with a laser sight—which had no magazine in it, but Olm didn't think to check or clear it, the Pocono Record reports. He pointed the laser around the room, then at Hunter.  Look, you have a red dot on your forehead,  one of the boys said. When his nephew reached for the gun, Olm pulled the trigger, striking him above the eye and causing him to fall over.  It's horribly tragic,  said a police lieutenant.  The family is devastated.

"(Jan 31, 2011  1:54 PM) BP's compensation fund for Gulf oil spill victims has issued a final settlement payment—to just one of the roughly 91,000 people and businesses waiting for checks, records show. And that $10 million payout went to a company after the oil giant intervened on its behalf. BP won't identify the business, citing confidentiality, but acknowledges it lobbied for the settlement. The amount far exceeds smaller stop-gap payments that some individuals and businesses have received while they wait for their own final settlements. Kenneth Feinberg, the administrator of BP's $20 billion compensation fund, said today that BP struck an outside deal with the business and told the fund to make the payment.  We never reviewed the claim,  Feinberg added.  We honored the request of the parties to fund the claim.  Feinberg, whose law firm is paid about $850,000 a month by BP, has faced repeated criticism from lawmakers, plaintiffs attorneys, and claimants who complain about a lack of transparency and independence from BP, as well as claims being shortchanged and paid too slowly, or not at all.

The  community safety police officer  will receive $108,000 per year to protect Menlo Park, Calif., a city of 30,000, NBC Bay Area reports. Amid word the city needed the funds, Facebook representatives made the offer late last year; yesterday, the city council unanimously approved the idea.

One man is said to be critically wounded, while eight others ranging in age from 21 to 46 were  seriously injured,  the news agency notes. Around 400 people were enjoying the evening, barbecuing and watching a basketball game, when shots rang out, with witnesses on the scene grabbing their kids and fleeing, leaving overturned strollers in their wake, ClickOnDetroit.com reports.

As the New York Times reports, the investigation thus far hasn't uncovered a design flaw. The apparent problem was a turbine blade in the engine whose  excessive rubbing  led to friction that broke a fan blade and started the fire; no other plane's turbine blades were found to have a similar issue. The jet has now been given a limited flight clearance with an engine inspection regimen and restrictions on its flights, but that clearance won't allow it to make its international debut before would-be buyers at the Farnborough International Airshow this week.

Elysium doesn't have its own rockets, notes Space.com. Instead, it's teamed up with robotics company Astrobotic Technology to hitch a ride, and plans its first lunar memorial launch later this year. As Popular Science explains, the ashes won't be buried; instead the capsules will sit on the moon's surface,  like space litter.  With its announcement, Elysium will be competing against a company out of Houston called Celestis, which plans to start launching ashes to the moon in the next few years for the slightly higher price of $12,500.

"(Oct 26, 2008  6:07 AM CDT) As John McCain's campaign appears to be foundering, Barack Obama's lead continues to grow, reports Bloomberg. The Democratic candidate was up 8 points over McCain in an average of 16 polls released during the last week. The previous week, Obama was up about 6 points. A single new poll released today, however, found the Democrat's lead shrinking to 5 points. He holds a resounding lead among voters with incomes less than $35,000 but is losing his edge among higher income groups, according to a daily tracking poll of likely voters by Reuters/C-Span/Zogby.  There seems to be a direct correlation between this and McCain talking about the economy,  said pollster John Zogby.  You've got to think that it is tax-and-spend that concerns voters.

The Washington Post reports that, under an agreement with attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, Equifax will offer up to $700 million: $425 million directly to breach victims, $175 million to the states, and $100 million in civil penalties to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Equifax ... had a responsibility to secure and protect Americans' data. Instead, it breached public trust,  reads a statement from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in announcing the deal, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Per the settlement terms, Equifax doesn't have to admit to any wrongdoing for  one of the most devastating data breaches to face our nation,  he adds. Equifax will also offer at least 10 years of free credit-monitoring services to consumers who've been affected by the leak of such critical personal data as names, Social Security numbers, addresses, birthdates, driver's license numbers, and passport and credit card information. The AP notes consumers will also be able to take advantage of free identity-restoration services and, starting Dec. 31, six free copies of their credit report in a 12-month span, for at least the next seven years. The Federal Trade Commission is also requiring the agency to take more rigorous security measures and to subject itself to two decades of regular independent audits to make sure it's doing right by consumers on the cybersecurity front.

The 25,000 deaths were first noticed on Saturday, as bees tumbled from 55 linden trees in bloom, the Oregonian reports.  They were literally falling out of the trees,  a biologist tells the Portland Tribune; he calculated that some 150 colonies likely met their end. Adds an agriculture official:  I've never encountered anything quite like it in 30 years in the business.  Pesticides—particularly a neonicotinoid called Safari that may have been sprayed by a landscape company on the trees on Saturday—could be to blame, though test results might not be in until the weekend. A Safari product label apparently warns that it's  highly toxic  for bees and shouldn't be used when they're around. Officials are now putting bee-blocking nets over the trees to halt the deaths, the Oregonian reports. Honeybee deaths have been widely reported, but bumblebees have also been in decline, the paper notes.

"(Sep 27, 2017  6:43 PM CDT) Russian investigators believe a couple may have killed, skinned, and eaten up to 30 people over the past two decades, even secretly feeding  canned human meat  to unsuspecting soldiers at the military academy where they worked, the Washington Post reports. According to the Moscow Times, a construction worker in the city of Krasnodar found a cellphone Sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's SIM card to 35-year-old Dmitry Baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among Russia's worst serial killers. While many details of the case are unknown or unconfirmed, authorities say the alleged murders date back to at least 1999, CNN reports. That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the BBC,  food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin  found in the apartment are being tested for human DNA. Authorities say Baksheev and his wife, Natalia Baksheeva, would knock their victims out with sedatives, though it's unclear how they chose their victims.

"(Oct 28, 2013  8:04 AM CDT) Israel's officials are deeply concerned about the threat of cyberwarfare, and an apparent attack last month in the northern city of Haifa may have validated those fears. On Sept. 8, a trojan horse attack—in which a hacker gains control over a system via software installed by unwitting users—hit security cameras in Israel's Carmel Tunnels toll road, an expert tells the AP. Right away, the major thoroughfare went on lockdown for 20 minutes; the next day it was closed for eight hours. And that led to more than headaches: It caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. The hack didn't appear to boast the sophistication of an enemy government attack; instead, it was likely the work of a group along the lines of Anonymous, the expert notes. The firm in charge of the toll road, on the other hand, says the problem was prompted by a  communication glitch,  not a cyberattack. If it is the work of hackers, however, it  is the hallmark of a new era,  says an outside security manager. Vulnerable systems are widespread, and Israel is  among the top-targeted countries,  he notes. Israel Electric Corp., for instance, faces some 6,000 unique attacks each second, it says.

In addition to facing some 8,000 lawsuits (at last count) claiming that glyphosate herbicides produced by Monsanto—a company that the drugmaker bought in June—cause cancer, Vietnam is now demanding compensation because of the use of another Monsanto product: the Vietnam War-era herbicide Agent Orange. The demand from Vietnam comes after a recent California verdict in the case of a former groundskeeper dying of cancer that put Monsanto on the hook for $289 million, the Independent reports. That verdict, a spokesman in Vietnam says,  refutes previous claims that the herbicides made by Monsanto and other chemical corporations in the US and provided for the US army in the war are harmless. Vietnam has suffered … lasting effects of toxic chemicals, including Agent Orange.  Some 12 million gallons of Agent Orange—so named after the orange stripe painted on the barrels that contained it— were dumped over Vietnam between 1961 and 1971 to defoliate the jungle, according to RT.com, exposing some three million people to the chemical dioxin, a toxic component of the herbicide linked to birth defects, cancer, and other health problems.

The first time around, the bill failed on the last day of a special legislative session; Gov. Rick Perry called for a second special session to start today, and Republicans are vowing to get the job done faster this time. The process must start over entirely, the AP reports, but as long as supporters of the bill can hustle a bit, there likely won't be a repeat of Davis' feat because it will come to a final vote while there's still too much time left in the session for a filibuster. ( No human being can talk for two weeks,  Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Saturday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Davis was also helped along by hundreds of protesters who cheered until the clock ran out, and opponents of the bill are planning to mobilize again.

"(Apr 1, 2016  8:13 AM CDT) US employers notched another solid month of hiring in March by adding a higher-than-expected 215,000 jobs, driven by large gains in the construction, retail, and health care industries, the AP reports. Despite the jump, the Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 5% from 4.9%. But that increase includes some good news: More Americans came off the sidelines to look for work, though not all found jobs. The figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff, even as overall growth has slowed since last winter. Steady hiring is also contributing to higher pay, which rose a modest 2.3% from a year earlier to $25.43. That figure has increased since the early years of the recovery but is below a peak of 2.6% reached in December. Sluggish wage growth has been a weak spot in the economy and a source of frustration for many workers since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Paychecks typically grow at a 3.5% pace in a strong economy. Construction firms added 37,000 jobs, likely aided by warmer weather. That helped offset another month of job losses in manufacturing, which has been hit by slower growth overseas, and mining, which includes the oil and gas drilling sector. Low oil prices have cost that industry 185,000 jobs since September 2014. Meanwhile, the MoneyBeat team at the Wall Street Journal has deemed Friday  datageddon  for all of the additional info scheduled to be released, including manufacturing data from the US, China, and Europe and an update from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index.","'Datageddon' Day: 215K More Jobs, but Unemployment Ticks Up","'Datageddon' Day: ____K More Jobs, but Unemployment Ticks Up",215,"Paraphrase( 215,000 , K )",1

"(Mar 7, 2016  7:20 PM) A Connecticut teen accused of stabbing a classmate to death at their high school for rejecting his invitation to the junior prom pleaded no contest to murder Monday, and prosecutors say they will seek a 25-year prison sentence. Christopher Plaskon, 18, accepted a plea bargain during a brief appearance in Milford Superior Court, the AP reports. Sentencing is set for June 6. Plaskon was charged with killing 16-year-old Maren Sanchez at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25, 2014. His family and friends said he became upset that Sanchez turned down his prom invitation. Plaskon was held at a psychiatric hospital after the stabbing. His attorneys were considering an insanity defense. Plaskon lawyer Edward Garvin said his client suffered from psychosis and called the claim that the stabbing was over a prom rejection  inaccurate.  State's Attorney Kevin Lawlor, however, said evidence from several sources pointed to the rejection as the reason for the attack. Garvin said state law would allow Plaskon to apply for parole in 13 years, based on the fact that he was 16 at the time of the killing. Lawlor said the plea bargain was the best result possible in the case. Sanchez was posthumously voted prom queen by her devastated friends.",'Prom Killer' Could Be Out in Just 13 Years,'Prom Killer' Could Be Out in Just ____ Years,13,Copy( 13 ),0
"(Jan 27, 2012  11:11 AM) A New York lawyer with a checkered past has relinquished his claim on a $7.5 million Iowa lottery jackpot, after being unable to explain how he got the ticket. It was the latest twist in what Iowa Lottery officials call the strangest episode in the game's 26-year history. The ticket was purchased back in December 2010, the AP explains. The lawyer, 76-year-old Crawford Shaw, claimed the prize hours before it expired last month, on behalf of a trust that he says benefits a corporation in Belize. The lottery demanded Shaw explain how he got the ticket by today in order to make sure it wasn't stolen, and to ensure it was purchased by a valid player. But Shaw yesterday said he didn't know who bought it, for reasons that have sparked much speculation.  I'm telling you, if I could take all of the suggestions, it would be a heck of a fun book,  says the lotto's CEO. Shaw has a suitably mysterious past; he's been sued for fraud in both Delaware and Texas, and helped found a company that later went bankrupt in a stock manipulation scheme.",Shady Lawyer Gives Up $7.5M Lotto Jackpot,Shady Lawyer Gives Up $____M Lotto Jackpot,7.5,Copy( 7.5 ),0

Bloomberg zeroes in on the story of Li Jianhua, a banking regulator who always put  the cause of the party and the people  first, according to his boss. He began working for the government in 1985, traveling and toiling even when he was ill; he skipped a recommended hospital visit because he  didn't have time.  This month, he died in the midst of overnight work at age 48. His bosses applauded his efforts in a statement, calling him  a model for party members and cadres of the China Banking Regulatory Commission  and urging others to  be like him, always firm in ideals and beliefs, the broader interest, loyal to the cause of the party and the people, unremitting struggle, sacrificing everything.  His case mirrors those of other white-collar workers in a culture that puts community first, says an expert. In China, notes another:  Any job worth doing is worth doing excessively.  Japan has grappled with similar issues, but the country's  affluenza (has) led to questioning … of norms and values.

The Italian man who allegedly destroyed nearly $8 million in Brunello di Montalcino wine in early December was just pissed off. Italian police say Andrea di Gisi, a disgruntled employee at the Case Basse vineyard, dumped 10 barrels containing 16,400 gallons of the estate's Soldera wine down the drain on the night of Dec. 2, reports Reuters. Bottles bearing the Soldera label start at $140. Di Gisi had worked at the winery for five years, but fought frequently with Gianfranco Soldera, the 75-year-old patriarch of the estate, say police. Their relationship reportedly grew worse after Soldera gave an apartment on the grounds to another employee instead of di Gisi. Investigators suspected di Gisi could have been behind the crime, and tapped his phone; they reportedly heard him talking about washing wine out of his clothes.

The gas wasn't as lethal as the stuff armies used on each other in World War I, but it was enough to irritate eyes and lungs, and cause vomiting. Swimmers and emergency responders described scenes of mayhem as scores of people suddenly began coughing and vomiting.

Instead, the president announces America's plans for a  giant leap to Mars,  with a  clear goal  to get humans to the red planet by the 2030s and then safely back home, with the  ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.  Obama says the government is working in tandem with private commercial firms, an initiative more carefully spelled out in a joint White House/NASA blog post. Seven companies are being funded to start working on  habitation systems  that will one day serve as spacecraft to transport astronauts on deep-space missions, including Mars trips. The second part of the initiative, starting this fall: giving private companies the chance to add their own  modules and other capabilities  onto the International Space Station. CNN notes Obama has long harbored the dream of traveling to Mars, even optimistically saying in a 2010 speech,  I expect to be around to see it.  His CNN op-ed reveals that almost childlike excitement about space travel, from his memories of sitting on his grandfather's shoulders to watch astronauts coming home to Hawaii to his tenure as president, when he  vowed to return science to its rightful place —which he notes the US has since done through expanded NASA technology, ISS innovations, and the creation of private-sector jobs devoted to space exploration.

So says the rape survivor in the case of Brock Allen Turner, 20, a former Stanford University swimmer sentenced Thursday to 6 months in county jail, probation, and registration as a sex offender—far short of the 10-year prison sentence he could have faced, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The survivor, now 23, was drunk and unconscious when Turner assaulted her behind a dumpster after meeting her at a campus party. The judge said a longer sentence would have  a severe impact  on the champion swimmer, but in her powerful court statement, the survivor criticizes the sentencing and describes the impact that night had on her.  I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone,  she says, per Buzzfeed.  After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream.  She describes not only the horrifying details of that night—like waking up on a hospital gurney, with genital abrasions and dirt inside her, not knowing what had happened—but the pain of learning that because she couldn't remember, she couldn't deny consent. For his part, Turner only apologized for drinking too much and never described his actions as sexual assault.

"(May 20, 2015  1:43 PM CDT) Seven former New Jersey nurses have been charged with criminal neglect in the case of a woman who needed her hand amputated after a broken finger wasn't treated properly. An indictment issued last month said seven Vineland Developmental Center nurses failed to aid the  physical or mental health  of resident Wendy Hart, whom officials described as physically and mentally disabled. Prosecutors alleged the nurses wrapped a bandage around Hart's hand so tightly that it developed gangrene and had to be amputated in April 2012, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services report. An orthopedic surgeon who saw Hart that month said the bandage  was wrapped so tight only God could have removed it.  Officials said two of the defendants were registered nurses and the others are licensed practical nurses. They are charged with endangering the welfare of a disabled person. Four of the nurses are also charged with official misconduct and falsifying or tampering with records. All seven were fired from the center; an additional practical nurse who wasn't criminally charged also was fired. A nurses' union rep said the length of time between the amputation and indictments reflects a broken system.  It's terrible, I understand, and am very sympathetic to the patients,  he said.  But for criminal charges to be brought three years after the fact and not even have a hearing? ... There is no fairness.

"(Dec 24, 2015  9:07 AM) In the 1950s, when abortions were rarely sanctioned and only when a committee of doctors approved them, somewhere between 200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed every year. One such case in particular grabbed grim headlines across the country: A young woman by the name of Jacqueline Smith—who wanted to keep her baby—was given a messy illegal abortion in her boyfriend's apartment on Dec. 24, 1955. Sixty years later, there are still lessons to learn from her gruesome death, writes Gillian Frank on Slate. The details captured the attention of many: A hospital attendant gave Smith, who was positioned on a couch covered in blankets and newspaper, 50 times too much anesthesia via an IV drip made from a broomstick and a bottle. When she died, he and Smith's boyfriend cut her body up into small pieces, covered them in Christmas wrapping paper, and placed the packets in Upper West Side trash bins. In her death, the Lebanon, Pennsylvania-born Smith was vilified as an easy woman by some and painted as a lamb in a rough town by others. Lost in the headlines was the larger plight of unwed mothers, the laws impeding access to contraception for both sexes, and the dearth of good sex education, notes Frank:  On Christmas Eve 1955, Jacqueline Smith was 20 years old and had her whole life ahead of her. The men who killed her went to jail, but there was no indictment of a society and policies that were also culpable. For too many Americans, Jacqueline Smith’s past is still all too present.

Cheryl Grimmer's family had recently moved to Australia when police believe the 3-year-old was abducted from changing rooms at Fairy Meadow Beach in Wollongong on Jan. 12, 1970. Investigators had little to go on apart from a ransom note that led nowhere and witness reports that a man was seen running toward a parking lot with a blonde girl in a towel. But when witnesses—aged 9 to 12 at the time of the crime—gathered for a re-enactment of the abduction two weeks ago, they described something investigators had apparently missed: a male, possibly 17 or 18, lurking near the changing rooms prior to Cheryl's disappearance, reports the Times.  He was just seen loitering … in the morning and the afternoon,  a detective says. Authorities believe the male—white with brown hair and blue eyes—may have snatched Cheryl after her brother, Ricky, took her to the ladies' changing room and then left to go get his mother, per News.com.au.

The clown-costumed woman shot Warren in the face, killing her. Nearly three decades later, an arrest has been made in the case, NBC News reports. Sheila Keen Warren, a suspect in the case almost from day one, was arrested in Virginia, officials announced Tuesday. Sources told detectives within months of Marlene Warren's murder that Sheila Keen was having an affair with Marlene's husband, Michael Warren, for whom she worked. But there was never enough evidence to charge her until DNA evidence could be retested recently with new technology. Michael Warren was also a suspect, especially since friends and family said his marriage to Marlene was struggling, but he ended up in prison on unrelated charges connected to his car rental agency for three years and then went off the radar. In 2002, he married Sheila Keen. Police say he was present when the 54-year-old woman was arrested; the two were apparently running a Tennessee restaurant together.  Any murder's horrific. It doesn't matter whether you're wearing a clown costume or not,  Palm Beach County sheriff's Sgt. Richard McAfee said at a press conference after the arrest, per CBS News. Marlene Warren, 40, had just finished breakfast with her 22-year-old son and his friends when she was shot, Local 10 reports.

Has he invested and made anything off it? Is the story complete fiction? He tells the Observer that he does run an investment club at his school, and that his simulated trades' return was pretty impressive.

But for Henry Rayhons, a former Republican legislator in Iowa, it's a trickier case. The 78-year-old is currently on trial, charged with felony sex abuse for allegedly having sex last May with his wife, Donna, in a nursing home a few days after he was told she wasn't able to consent to intimate relations, the New York Times reports. Donna, who died in August, suffered from dementia, with nursing home staff noting she no longer remembered her daughters' names, how to recall everyday words, or how to eat certain foods.  You could see that Donna had Alzheimer's. ... She was just in her pleasant little world,  a nurse from Concord Care Center testified yesterday in Garner, per the Quad-City Times.

"(Mar 29, 2017  3:02 PM CDT) More fallout from Toshiba's reported  nuclear  loss last month, this time in the form of a bankruptcy filing. In what the AP says was a  largely expected  move, Toshiba noted in a statement Wednesday that its Westinghouse nuclear unit has submitted a Chapter 11 petition to the US Bankruptcy Court of New York. This announcement leaves up in the air what's going to happen to four still-to-be-finished nuclear reactors in South Carolina and Georgia, which were plagued with surpassed budgets and missed deadlines, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters reports that Toshiba—which ventured into nuclear waters when it purchased Westinghouse for $5.4 billion in 2006—is expecting to take a $9 billion loss for the year ending March 31. The New York Times details some of the company's challenges in the nuclear industry, including more affordable forms of other alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, as well as safety fears spurred by the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A Westinghouse statement says that while the firm attempts to reorganize under Chapter 11 parameters, it will be kept afloat by special $800 million financing. Reuters notes the bankruptcy will allow Westinghouse to figure out whether it's worth it to keep plugging ahead on the nuclear reactor projects, some of which are only about a third completed. Some say Toshiba's unique situation can be applied more broadly to the nuclear industry in general.  This … illustrates that there is no bright future for nuclear anymore,  a consultant tells the Journal, which notes that Westinghouse boldly proclaims  We Are Nuclear Energy  on its site.",Toshiba Throws In Nuclear Towel: Chapter 11 for Westinghouse,Toshiba Throws In Nuclear Towel: Chapter ____ for Westinghouse,11,Copy( 11 ),0

The playwright died 400 years ago Saturday, but remains the world's most famous writer, living on through endlessly reinterpreted plays and globally known characters, including the tormented prince Hamlet and the star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet. The anniversary of Shakespeare's death on April 23, 1616, is being marked across Britain with parades, church services, and—of course—stage performances. President Obama took a break from political talks in London to tour Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on Saturday, listening to Hamlet's  To be or not to be  soliloquy and admiring the open-air venue—a recreation of the theater, built in 1599, where many of the Bard's plays were first performed.

They've performed Shakespeare's tragedy on a tennis court in Kabul, Afghanistan, in a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan, and at the UN General Assembly in New York.

A rep for Harrison's publisher told the AP that Harrison died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Ariz. The cause of death was unknown. Harrison's wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last fall. The versatile author completed more than 30 books, most recently the novella collection The Ancient Minstrel, and was admired worldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of his interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin near his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood script writer who was close with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles, and Warren Beatty. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary appetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of tales. Published in 1979, Legends of the Fall was a collection of three novellas that featured the title story about Montana rancher Col.

"(Nov 5, 2016  2:32 PM CDT) Portraying all the contents of a spherical Earth on a flat, two-dimensional piece of paper is notoriously difficult, which is why we've relied on, for more than four centuries, a map that inaccurately shows Greenland, Alaska, and Antarctica as imposingly huge. But now a new map by Japanese artist and architect Hajime Narukawa is so proportionally accurate that it may simply have no match, reports Gizmodo. You can print the AuthaGraph World Map and fold it up into a globe—taking it from 2D to 3D—and still maintain proper land and water proportions, a feat so impressive that it has just won the esteemed Japanese Good Design Award. (If you think it sounds easy, try folding the Mercator projection, created in 1569, into a globe and see what you get. So how did Narukawa do it? The key, as Popular Mechanics explains, was to divvy up the planet  into 96 equal regions and then [transfer] the dimensions from a sphere to a tetrahedron  (four equilateral triangles laid into the shape of one larger one) and then transfer them again to a rectangular map. The map's accuracy could improve further if the number of subdivisions increases, the Good Design Award description notes, but as it currently stands the map  faithfully represents all oceans, continents including the neglected Antarctica.  It won't necessarily sound the death knell for the Mercator projection, though; Popular Mechanics points out it  doesn't align according to the cardinal directions.  It's on sale in poster and globe form through its own AuthaGraph site.

About 20% of the city's 911 calls—around 500 a month—fall under the category of  unintentional  or  abandoned,  and police blame most of them on people sitting on their phones or something similar, reports CBS Chicago.  I don't think the public realizes how often this happens,  says Evanston's 911 coordinator.  When you consider the number of these types of calls that we receive, it really taxes our resources.  The growing problem likely stems from the fact that many new phones have a 911-specific button.

The boy, who isn't being named due to his age, shot his father, 32-year-old Jeff Hall, in the head when he was 10. He'll be sentenced on Feb. 15, and faces up to 11 years in juvenile detention, the Press-Enterprise reports. He was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors argued that the killing was cold and premeditated—the boy's sister testified that he told her he intended to kill Hall days before he did so. The defense initially entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, but later withdrew it, arguing that the boy had been abused, and raised in a violent home where killing was deemed acceptable. Both sides agreed his father's National Socialist Movement ties weren't a motivating factor. Instead, the boy said he was mad at Hall for spanking and kicking him, and worried he'd leave the family for another woman, separating him from his stepmother.",12-Year-Old Convicted for Murder of Neo-Nazi Dad,____-Year-Old Convicted for Murder of Neo-Nazi Dad,12,Copy( 12 ),0

H7N9 has already killed two people and left a third in critical condition; the four new patients, aged 32 to 83, are also critically ill, the New York Times reports. Chinese officials had previously thought humans weren't susceptible to H7N9, and they still maintain that human-to-human transmissions haven't occurred. Notably, one new victim is a poultry butcher. There is no vaccine for H7N9, and the AP reports that it also may be more difficult to track than H5N1, which killed hundreds in Asia starting a decade ago. Scientists say H7N9 may be able to spread among poultry undetected, causing no symptoms in the birds but making humans very ill. The virus also appears to have mutated, meaning it could infect other animals—including pigs, though Beijing emphasized Monday that there was no link to the 15,000 dead pigs in a Shanghai river.

Prosecutors say Abdullakh Anzorov, 18—who was later shot dead by police—paid two students, age 14 and 15, to identify Samuel Paty when he left his school on Friday. Anzorov told them he planned to  film the teacher [and] make him apologize for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad],  said anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard, adding that the killer said he wanted  to humiliate him, to hit him.  Ricard said the students hung out with Anzorov for over two hours waiting for the teacher to appear.

The father of one of Paty's students is accused of launching the campaign and texting with the killer before the attack.

Meanwhile, the Guardian reports that French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed the Légion d’honneur posthumously on Paty in a private ceremony Wednesday at Sorbonne university.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office responded after Burkhalter was found in possession of cannabidiol oil during a bag check at Magic Kingdom. Burkhalter said her doctor had prescribed the  federally legal CBD oil,  which is derived from the cannabis plant, to soothe her arthritis. But police said the oil contained THC, the psychoactive property in cannabis, and arrested the 69-year-old for possession of hashish; the one-ounce bottle was labeled  zero THC.

"(Feb 21, 2014  8:15 AM) Colorado and Utah are taking a page from Michael Bloomberg's book: Both states have moved to raise the smoking age to 21, following a similar bill passed in New York City last fall. The proposals were given the initial go-ahead yesterday, and though more votes are needed, this is the furthest any state has gone to rein in teen access to cigarettes, the AP notes. Utah—with the nation's lowest smoking rate at 12% as of 2011—is already one of only four states that require tobacco purchasers to be 19. The smoking rate is low in Colorado, too, at about 18%, but health advocates only want to see it fall.  What I'm hoping to do is make it harder for kids to obtain cigarettes,  says Colorado Rep. Cheri Gerou, while a Utah woman adds,  By raising the age limit, it puts them in a situation where they're not going to pick it up until a much later age.  A study last year found 90% of daily smokers have their first cigarette by 18, and 90% of those who buy cigarettes for minors are between 18 and 20. Still, the Salt Lake Tribune notes it was an  emotional debate  in Utah, with opponents arguing adults should be free to make their own choices—even if they're bad ones—and noting a  slippery slope  could lead to bans on high-calorie foods ... or teen motorcycle riding.","Colorado, Utah Propose: Under 21?

"(Mar 10, 2017  5:04 PM) Crocodiles and their ancestors have been roaming the Earth for 200 million years, rubbing shoulders (do crocodiles even have shoulders?) with the dinosaurs, the BBC reports. Now researchers—in a study published this week in PLOS One—say they've discovered the world's oldest known crocodile eggs. The fossilized eggs are 152 million years old and were dug up during a years-long excavation in Portugal—with some of them found in dinosaur nests, strangely enough. Researchers say it's unclear why the crocodile eggs were in dinosaur nests, but it seems  to suggest some form of biological relationship.  The eggs were laid by members of a group of prehistoric crocodiles known as crocodylomorphs. The Telegraph reports they appear to be from two different types of crocodylomorph. The newly discovered eggs are 40 million years older than the previous oldest known crocodile eggs and yet are strikingly similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles. One egg clutch contained 13 intact eggs, making it the most complete clutch of ancient crocodile eggs ever found.

The dog was first spotted at an apartment complex near Houston's Hobby Airport, KTRK reports—sometimes on the steps, sometimes at the complex's front gates, sometimes camped out at one particular apartment's front door.  You could just tell that he was a lost dog,  neighbor Cassandra Eubanks says.  He would follow the cars and when he would realize that it was not his owner's car, he would just stand there and look helpless.  What the poor pup didn't realize: His owner, 54-year-old Hatem Abuharbid, had been killed in a robbery Feb. 7 at the convenience store where he worked, ABC News reports.  Of course he's confused, because he doesn't know what's going on,  Eubanks says. The dog wouldn't approach neighbors who left food and water out for him, but he was eventually rescued by a woman who had heard about his plight on social media.  It just broke my heart to hear that the poor animal lost his owner, his best friend,  Maranda Perez tells KTRK. She brought her own dog along and worked patiently for about an hour to make the now-ownerless dog comfortable around her. After following him up three flights of stairs, Perez was finally able to place a leash around his neck and get him, with some resistance, into her car.  He was still very shaken up whenever I touched him,  she says. Perez says she'll take care of him for the next week or so before Abuharbid's brother takes the dog in.

"(Jun 13, 2018  4:40 PM CDT) Comcast made a $65 billion bid Wednesday for Fox's entertainment businesses, setting up a battle with Disney to become the next mega-media company, the AP reports. The bid comes just a day after a federal judge cleared AT&T's takeover of Time Warner and rejected the government's argument that it would hurt competition in cable and satellite TV and jack up costs to consumers for streaming TV and movies. The ruling signaled that Comcast could win regulatory approval, too; its bid for Fox shares many similarities with the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Comcast says its cash bid is 19% higher than the value of Disney offer as of Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal and others reported earlier that Comcast had lined up $60 billion in cash to challenge Disney for media mogul Rupert Murdoch's company. Disney's offer was for $52.5 billion when it was made in December, though the final value will depend on the stock price at the closing.","Comcast Challenges Disney, Offers $65B for Fox","Comcast Challenges Disney, Offers $____B for Fox",65,Copy( 65 ),0
"(Aug 3, 2017  3:17 PM CDT) A woman who encouraged her suicidal boyfriend to kill himself in dozens of text messages and told him to  get back in  a truck filled with toxic gas was sentenced Thursday to 15 months in jail for involuntary manslaughter, the AP reports. Michelle Carter was convicted in June by a judge who said her final instruction to Conrad Roy III caused his death. Carter was 17 when the 18-year-old Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in July 2014. Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz gave Carter a 2½-year jail sentence but said she had to serve only 15 months of that. He also sentenced her to five years of probation. He granted a defense motion that would keep Carter out of jail until her appeals in Massachusetts courts are exhausted. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, had asked the judge to spare his client any jail time and instead give her five years of probation and require her to receive mental health counseling. Prosecutor Maryclare Flynn called probation  just not reasonable punishment  for Carter's role in Roy's death. The prosecution sought the maximum sentence of 20 years. Cataldo argued that Roy was determined to kill himself and nothing Carter did could change that. Cataldo also argued that Carter's words amounted to free speech protected by the First Amendment. In convicting Carter, the judge focused his ruling on Carter telling Roy to  get back in  after he climbed out of his truck as it was filling with carbon monoxide and told her he was afraid.

(Watch the capsule, attached to four parachutes, touch down in the water here.) The flight from the International Space Station took about six hours, the AP reports.

The Verge reports there was one especially notable achievement for SpaceX during this test flight: The unmanned Crew Dragon managed to dock itself to an exterior ISS port, a move the company had never done before, and one that's needed if SpaceX eventually ferries people to the space station. There was one  witness  on board the capsule: a  smart  test dummy named Ripley, which was built to measure how the human body would be affected.

"(Sep 19, 2011  6:59 PM CDT) A federal appeals court voted 2-1 today to throw out the 17-year sentence handed to alleged  dirty bomber  Jose Padilla, saying that it was too low given his criminal history and the threat he poses.  Padilla’s sentence of 12 years below the low end of the Guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment,  the majority wrote in their ruling, according to ABC News.  Padilla poses a heightened risk of future dangerousness due to his al-Qaeda training.  The dissenting judge said she disagreed, because overturning the sentence  simply substitutes this Court’s sentencing judgment for that of the trial judge, in whom that authority inheres.  When Padilla was arrested in 2002, John Ashcroft accused him of plotting to blow up a dirty bomb, but when he was eventually brought to trial in civilian court, there was no mention of a bomb—he was merely accused of being part of a cell that funneled recruits and cash to al-Qaeda and other terrorists.

In New Zealand, 19-year-old Etienne Naude placed a slice of bread on the ground at a precisely calculated spot. In Spain, 34-year-old Angel Sierra did the same, reports the BBC. The result is an  earth sandwich —two slices of bread placed on opposite sides of the planet with about 7,900 miles of earth between them, per the Guardian. See the resulting images for yourself via Reddit. (Sierra actually placed nine slices on the ground, to make extra-sure he hit his precise coordinate.) The men used longitude and latitude to figure out where to lay their respective slices of bread. Technically speaking, they placed the slices on antipodes—points opposite each other on the Earth's surface.  We made sure to get the exact location with Google Maps, to get us within a few meters range, and then we used the actual image data on Google Maps to pinpoint ourselves even closer than that,  Naude tells RNZ. His spot was relatively close to where he lived, but Sierra had to travel several miles.  It's quite tough to find a spot which isn't water on the New Zealand end—and where public roads or paths intersect in both sides,  he says.

Amber Heard, 29, was charged Tuesday with two counts of illegally importing the Yorkshire terriers, and one count of providing a false document, reports NBC News. Depp and Heard brought their two dogs into the country on a private jet, but didn’t declare them on the passenger manifest, get a permit, or have them quarantined. The process is serious business Down Under to prevent the spread of rabies and other diseases.

Within minutes, an officer who'd reached the 31st floor of the 43-story Mandalay Bay commented that he could hear  automatic fire coming from … one floor above us.  Per a Times analysis of video of 15 seconds of the attack, about 90 shots were fired in just 10 seconds. Police communications suggest the shooting had ended by 10:25pm, when officers arrived outside Suite 135 on the 32nd floor, though a hotel security guard was at one point shot through the suite door. It took almost an hour for SWAT teams to secure the floor before Paddock's room was accessed using an explosive device. Paddock, who'd allegedly smashed the floor-to-ceiling windows in the suite in order to take aim at a crowd of 22,000 gathered for the Route 91 Harvest festival 500 yards away, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 11:20pm, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

"(Apr 10, 2019  2:28 AM CDT) The first day of spring was weeks ago—but there's still a serious bout of winter weather on its way for the central US. The Rockies and Plains could be hit by the second  bomb cyclone  in two months Wednesday as an April blizzard causes a drastic drop in pressure in cities like Denver, which experienced temperatures of around 80 degrees Tuesday, NPR reports. The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions are expected in the central and northern plains, in states including Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota. South of the heavy snow, severe thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected from the central plains to the middle Mississippi Valley, exacerbating flooding in some areas. The National Weather Service office in Colorado says precipitation will start as rain Wednesday but snow is expected as the colder air moves in. In Minneapolis, forecasters say the  potentially historic winter storm  could drop up to a foot of snow. The system will be considered a  bomb cyclone  if the air pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours, reports CNN, which notes that it is rare for a single storm this size to develop inland, let alone two in less than 30 days. But even if it doesn't end up fitting the cyclone definition,  we're talking a blockbuster blizzard,  meteorologist Jeff Berardelli tells CBS. He predicts that the storm will move slowly across the region for two days after hitting the central Plains on Wednesday.

Moody, famed for his versatility, dexterity, and ebullient stage persona, died after a 10-month battle with pancreatic cancer, reports the San Diego Tribune.

That all changed Thursday, when Chief Art Acevedo said during a presser that's exactly what investigators believe happened.  The evidence shows that she's been murdered,  Acevedo said, per the Houston Chronicle.  I can sit here and say we're going to find her alive, but I'd be lying.

In a Thursday presser, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said the DNA of registered sex offender Robert Eugene Koehler has been linked to at least 24 sexual assaults believed to have been carried out by the  Pillowcase Rapist.  Per CNN, when investigators searched the 60-year-old's home, they made a disturbing find underneath: a dug-out area they think Koehler was prepping to be a  dungeon,  according to Miami-Dade County prosecutor Laura Adams.  We feared very much that if we had not gotten him into custody that he may have had other plans even worse than what he executed on all of these women,  Adams said. She added that investigators also found safes at the home, one of which housed jewelry and other items that authorities suspect may have been mementos from his alleged attacks. The Washington Post reports the big break in the case came when Koehler's 29-year-old son was recently arrested for domestic violence; the DNA authorities collected from him closely matched the Pillowcase Rapist's, so investigators started focusing on the elder Koehler. They obtained his DNA by tailing him to a public area then swabbing objects he'd touched.  This familial contact was ... just what we needed to be able to piece this all together,  Rundle said, per the New York Times. Koehler has pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexual battery related to a 1983 attack on a 25-year-old woman.

Tiffany Alberts, 44, got seven years behind bars and five years' probation on charges of aggravated battery and neglect, but beat an attempted murder rap. Back in 2016, Alberts pumped fecal matter into her 15-year-old son's IV at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis, where he was being treated for leukemia. Doctors noticed that the boy developed mysterious and persistent blood infections, which forced them to stop his chemotherapy for nearly two months. Doctors said he might have died from septic shock, per Fox 59. Alberts initially said she used water to  flush it as the medicine that was given to him burned,  but later admitted it was fecal matter she stored in a gift bag in the bathroom sink of her son's room, per WGN. Her explanation? She did it to have him bumped to another floor for better medical treatment. Hospital staff later uncovered Alberts' crime on hospital surveillance footage.

The food company known for Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch has announced that consumers will be able to pour milk later this month over Tiny Toast, its first new cereal since 2001, when it debuted Harmony, a  nutritional women's cereal,  Business Insider reports. Tiny Toast, which will come in blueberry and strawberry versions, is meant to tickle the taste buds of both kids and parents with its  all-family appeal  and boasts an ambitious goal: to taste and smell like actual fruit.  People told us that both varieties tasted real, and not fake like they typically associate with fruit-flavored cereals,  a GM developer says in a blog post on the new breakfast dish, which is shaped, as suggested, like tiny pieces of toast, coated with bits of blueberry and strawberry.  We heard from several consumers that the Blueberry Tiny Toast tastes like a blueberry muffin, which is just awesome praise.  With its real fruit (as well as no high-fructose corn syrup or artificial flavors and colors), Tiny Toast was also designed to lure health-conscious noshers, CBS News reports.

Police tailed and arrested Theresa Wiltse, 49, after she got the ransom for Sandra Harris, 69, at a gourmet grocery store Friday night, the AP reports.  Theresa confessed to being part of the kidnapping,  along with two men she identified only as  Jose  and  Jesus,  the report said. But her  role appears to be much bigger than she claims,  police wrote, adding that blood was found in the backseat of Wiltse's vehicle and it was being analyzed. Police only have Wiltse in custody but said they were not ruling out the possibility of additional arrests. The kidnapping was not random—Wiltse knew the victim and her husband, Randy Harris, who owns a pawn shop in the city of Kennewick called Ace Jewelry and Loan, authorities said, though exactly how they knew each other is still under investigation. Harris was kidnapped Friday from her Kennewick home, police said. Harris called her husband at work from her cellphone to say the kidnapper was demanding money, they said. The FBI joined local police in contacting the suspect and negotiating for several hours before agreeing to meet up in rural Franklin County that night to pay the ransom. Shortly afterward, a SWAT team arrested Wiltse near the tiny community of Eltopia. She was driving a rental car with California plates.

"(Jul 29, 2019  6:46 PM CDT) President Trump signed a measure Monday extending the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund indefinitely. The Senate gave it final approval last week after a Congress-shaming campaign by comedian Jon Stewart. Extending the fund is  a sacred duty,  Trump said Monday.  Today we come together as one nation to support our September 11th heroes to care for their families and to renew our eternal vow—never, ever forget,  he said, per CNN. First responders, people affected by the attacks, and lawmakers attended the Rose Garden ceremony. One lawmaker who said she was not invited was the measure's lead co-sponsor, Rep. Carolyn Maloney. The Democrat had worn a New York firefighter jacket since February, per CBS, and pledged she wouldn't take it off until Congress passed the funding. Before the signing ceremony, Trump called first responders to the stage to make sure it wouldn't collapse.  I don't know if this stage will hold it, but if it doesn't, we're not falling very far,  he said, per Newsweek. Speaking of Ground Zero, he told the first responders:  I was down there also—but I’m not considering myself a first responder. But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you.  It's not clear what he could have been referring to: Politico has reported that he spent the day at Trump Tower, four miles from the World Trade Center.

Bangkok's bomb squad chief says construction workers found the bomb buried at a building site and sold it to the scrap shop. Workers at the shop were using a gas-powered thermal cutter to take the bomb apart when it exploded yesterday. The massive blast ripped apart the scrap shop in Bangkok's Lad Plakao neighborhood and damaged nearby houses. Authorities initially reported seven dead, but search crews later found a child's body in the rubble, believed to be a girl about 4 years old.

The convoy was attempting to deliver aid through an Israeli blockade. Turkey blasted Israel's  inhumane practices  in a statement following the attack, and dozens of protesters tried to storm the Israeli consulate in Istanbul.

Exercising 92 minutes per week could substantially extend your life, according to a new study. Researchers in Taiwan studied more than 400,000 subjects between 1996 and 2008, and deduced that those who exercised even a little bit were 14% less likely to die during the next eight years and lived an average three years longer, reports the Washington Post.  If the minimum amount of exercise we suggest is adhered to, mortality from heart disease, diabetes and cancer could be reduced,  wrote the scientists.  This low volume of physical activity could play a central part in the global war against non-communicable diseases, reducing medical costs and health disparities.

The 86-year-old Florida woman logged 89 cruises with her husband of 50 years, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. After he died of cancer in 1997 (making her promise to keep cruising the day before he passed),  Mama Lee  traded her Fort Lauderdale home for one on the open seas. She tells the Asbury Park Press she spent three years aboard a Holland America ship but  the day they announced they were stopping the dance host program was the day I decided to leave.  She has since spent almost seven years living on the Crystal Serenity (which, yes, has dance hosts to take the floor with the partner-less). Her estimated 2015 cost: $164,000. That covers her seventh-deck stateroom, meals, gratuities, and, of course, all that sailing. She says she stopped counting countries after hitting 100 (she said she had completed 200 cruises in her first four years on the Crystal Serenity), but she typically no longer goes ashore when the liner docks—though she can't resist Istanbul and its Grand Bazaar.

"(Jan 28, 2017  11:25 AM) Invasive grass carp have reached three of the Great Lakes and pose a significant environmental risk there, but time remains to prevent them from getting out of hand, according to a scientific analysis released Friday. The voracious grass carp is among four Asian carp species threatening to reach the world's largest surface freshwater system, the AP reports. Grass carp have been found in Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario, although it's uncertain how many there are or how widely they have spread, US and Canadian researchers said. At least some are reproducing. A spokesperson for the Great Lakes Fisher Commission says the risk to the Great Lakes is  pretty substantial.  Grass carp were introduced to the US in the early 1960s to control weed growth in waterways. Some escaped into the Mississippi River and have migrated northward toward the Great Lakes. They've been turning up more often in recent years, and the threat of a full-fledged invasion appears to be rising. The analysis said it is  very likely  that grass carp will become established in Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario within 10 years unless effective steps are taken to stop them. Researchers are studying how to prevent that. Tougher enforcement of laws against bringing them into the region would help, along with greater care to prevent release of fertile fish from hatcheries.",Study Says Grass Carp Have Invaded 3 of the Great Lakes,Study Says Grass Carp Have Invaded ____ of the Great Lakes,3,Trans( three ),1

A typed, unsigned letter sent to Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack gave the name of a potential suspect, now the focus of an active investigation, reports CNN. Illinois State Police say they've  conducted an investigative workup  and are trying to locate the individual. The revelation comes via a police affidavit in response to a public-records lawsuit from McCullough's son-in-law, who's asking for the case files to be released. What has been revealed about the case: A man who identified himself as  Johnny  approached Ridulph and a friend as they were playing outside on Dec. 3, 1957, offered to give them piggyback rides, then disappeared with Ridulph as her friend ran home to get mittens.

Usually, campaigns are kept close to the president’s DC home, where they’re easily accessible, said a Democratic consultant:  In modern presidential history, this is kind of revolutionary.   For people who have been in the White House the past two years, it's probably a good idea to get outside the presidential bubble,  the consultant added. It could also help prevent leaks, since staffers won’t be mixing with reporters so much. The tough part will be keeping the White House and the campaign staff in sync, said a former Carter administration official:  A campaign is a full-time job and running a White House is a full-time job, and the people have to be compatible with each other because events mainly determine reelection.",2008 All Over Again: Obama to Base Campaign in Chicago,____ All Over Again: Obama to Base Campaign in Chicago,2008,Copy( 2008 ),0

And no one initially disputed the Sudanese immigrant's age of 17—until apparently this week, when the basketball star was found to probably be a 30-year-old man and arrested for allegedly violating the country's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nicola, who had his first detention review Tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in Canada from Sudan in November, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life.  I don't know how many of [my friends] have a clue of how it is in Africa,  he had told the Star back in January. But during his five-month stint on the school's basketball team, his size raised eyebrows.

Basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone.

The most common infections, according to a CDC survey: pneumonia (22%), surgical site injections (22%), and gastrointestinal infections (17%). Hospitals have curbed the problem somewhat, but throw in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and hospital patients have something to worry about.  Today and every day, more than 200 Americans with healthcare-associated infections will die during their hospital stay,  said CDC Director Tom Frieden. A second CDC report included some good news—that infections from  central lines  inserted in major blood vessels have dropped 44% since 2008, and 10 surgical procedures saw a 20% drop, Medical News Today reports.

"(Nov 25, 2015  3:48 AM) A former National Security Agency employee convicted of selling defense and communication secrets he gained during his career has been released from federal custody 30 years after his arrest. The sentence for Cold War-era spy Ronald Pelton, 74, ended on Tuesday. He had been placed on home confinement several months ago to serve out the final stretch of his sentence and was released Tuesday from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, an agency spokesman says. Pelton, a former NSA intelligence communications specialist, was arrested in November 1985 on charges of selling information to the Soviets about signals intelligence between 1980 and 1985 for $35,000 plus expenses. Pelton worked for 14 years for the NSA before resigning in 1979. The FBI says Pelton, because of financial problems, approached the Soviet Embassy after leaving the agency and offered to sell the secrets. Prosecutors have said a Soviet KGB agent who defected and later returned to Moscow tipped investigators to Pelton. Among the secrets Pelton gave up was information about Operation Ivy Bells, an effort by the NSA and the Navy to tap Soviet communications cables that were laid under the ocean. He was sentenced to three life terms in 1986 by a federal judge who said he had betrayed a  special position of trust,  compromised citizens of the United States, and endangered US agents.

The third figure in the famous 1951 spying case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg—found guilty of conspiracy against the US, a charge Sobell once likened to  talking about espionage —died in Manhattan on Dec. 26, his son confirmed Wednesday, per the Times. He was 101. Overshadowed by his co-defendants, who were executed in 1953, Sobell served almost 18 years of a 30-year sentence in federal prison before his release in 1969. The son of Russian immigrants would maintain his innocence for another four decades before finally admitting to stealing classified military documents for the Soviets beginning at the end of World War II, though he stressed that he provided no information on the atomic bomb, per the Washington Post. Prosecutors alleged the Rosenbergs helped the Soviets replicate the bomb, though many believe their roles in the case were exaggerated. Indeed, Sobell argued Ethel was only guilty  of being Julius' wife.  Sobell, however, was said to have passed military secrets to Julius, his college classmate, while working in General Electric's aircraft and marine engineering division. Sobell eventually fled to Mexico, where he was apprehended in August 1950. In prison, he befriended convicted murderer Robert Stroud. After his release, he worked in medical electronics and developed a low-cost hearing aid.  I thought the USSR was a genuine socialist country and this was the ideal,  he later told the Wall Street Journal of his spying role.

"(Sep 25, 2017  12:42 PM CDT) Violent crime in America rose for the second straight year in 2016, but it remained near historically low levels, according to FBI data released Monday. The numbers were driven by a spike in killings in some major cities, per the AP. Violent crimes such as shootings and robberies rose 4.1% in 2016 from the year before, with homicides climbing 8.6%, according to the figures. Violence increased 3.9% in 2015, while killings jumped by more than 10%. The Trump administration immediately seized on the figures as proof that the nation is in the midst of a dangerous crime wave that warrants a return to tougher tactics like more arrests and harsher punishments for drug criminals. But criminologists cautioned the new numbers may not indicate the start of a long-term trend, noting that violent crime rates remain well below where they were a quarter-century ago. Still, the FBI said it was the first time violent crime rose in consecutive years in more than a decade.  This is a frightening trend that threatens to erode so much progress that had made our neighborhoods and communities safer—over 30 years [of] declines in crime are being replaced by increases,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last week. He has directed the nation's federal prosecutors to seek tougher sentences against most suspects, including some low-level drug offenders, and has urged prosecutors to focus more intensely on prosecuting gun cases. Still, the violent crime rate in 2016 was down significantly from several years ago.

It's the second straight month of strong growth. The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate remained a low 4.9% in July. More Americans launched job searches, and nearly all were hired, but the influx of job seekers meant that the number of unemployed fell only slightly.

But the country's three-year census of its water—a first-of-its-kind effort involving 800,000 surveyors and released last week—revealed a drastically different count. As of 2011, just 22,909, reports the Verge, which asks the million-dollar question: Why did 27,000 rivers vanish? The answer is an easy one, a census director tells the South China Morning Post: That 50,000 figure was arrived at using topographical maps as many as 60 years old, which were incomplete. The Post cited climate change and water and soil loss as well, but the Verge reports that China itself may have had a heavier hand in the decrease. It spoke with Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, who agreed that the answers offered by the government likely played a role; but he cited pollution and overpopulation as key factors. As the Verge explains, the destruction caused by flooding in the 1960s led the country to erect dams and reservoirs that reined in flooding but messed with the ecological system, causing rivers to go dry.

This is at least the 14th time since 2007 that a foot has washed up on the coastline of the Canadian province, the Guardian reports. There were only two pairs among the found feet, meaning they came from a dozen individuals. The Mounties say the latest find was made by a man walking his dog along a beach on Sunday, the Province reports. No other human remains were found in the area. Authorities have identified six of the people the feet came from and foul play is not suspected in any of the deaths: they died either in accidents or by suicide and the feet apparently separated from the bodies after a long period in the water.

The breaches include 14,000 people who have found their way into sensitive areas and 6,000 travelers who made it past screeners without proper scrutiny, CNN reports. The TSA stresses that the breaches represent a tiny fraction of the 5.5 billion passengers it has processed over the last decade, but the Republican overseeing the security hearing called 25,000 a  stunningly high number,  CBS News reports. Rep. Jason Chaffetz accused the agency of focusing on creating the appearance of security while not actually making airports more secure.

But 24,000 people left with questionable convictions as a result of her fraud are still waiting to see if their names will be cleared. Not for much longer, though. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has until April 18 to decide who among the group will be re-prosecuted without evidence touched by Dookhan. And though prosecutors are still deciding on cases, a rep for the Middlesex County District Attorney says the number of convictions that will be kept on the books will likely be  in the hundreds,  per NBC News. In other words, more than 95% of them will be vacated, reports the Boston Globe.  There are no words for it … It's absolutely stunning,  says a member of the National Commission of Forensic Science. While this means some who did commit crimes may see their convictions overturned, it also means those wrongfully convicted will finally get justice, including non-citizens who've been threatened with deportation, defense lawyers say. The ACLU of Massachusetts says that about 90% of the convictions are for misdemeanors or minor felonies, usually involving drug possession, and that most defendants have already finished their sentences.

The lawyer representing Debra Harrell pro bono says McDonald's has let her go, but he isn't sure why, reports ThinkProgress. A McDonald's spokeswoman declined to comment. Harrell has been charged with unlawful neglect of a child, and her lawyer says that although she has been reunited with her daughter, the Department of Social Services probe is ongoing. According to the blog Reason, Harrell had been bringing her daughter to work and letting her play on a laptop, but she started dropping her off at a nearby park while she worked after their home was broken into and the laptop was stolen. The lawyer tells CNN he thinks it's  absurd  to say the girl was  abandoned  at the park a few minutes' walk from her house.  Because if this woman gets convicted, guess what? ...

About 170 miles southeast, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, two bodies were found inside burned-out homes, Calaveras County Coroner Kevin Raggio says. One of the victims was identified as Mark McCloud, 65, who was found inside his residence in the Mountain Ranch area. Raggio wouldn't release the name of the second victim, also found in Mountain Ranch, because the family had not been notified. Raggio says both were found in an area where mandatory evacuations were ordered after the fire burning 60 miles southeast of Sacramento exploded in size over the weekend. Investigators are looking into whether that blaze was sparked after a live tree came in contact with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. power lines.

But the brightly-colored paintings and inscriptions are just part of the fascination. The wooden coffins stacked in two layers are sealed just  as the ancient Egyptians left them,  CNN quotes a ministry statement as saying. They were discovered at Asasif, on the west bank of the Nile River in Luxor, not far from the Valley of the Kings. Asasif is home to tombs from both the Late Period (664-332BC) and the 18th Dynasty (1550-1292BC), from which came the rulers Hatshepsut, Akhenaton, and Tutankhamun, per the BBC. More information is to be revealed at a Saturday news conference. It will come just over a week after the ministry announced the discovery of a manufacturing area, firmly dated to the 18th Dynasty, in the Valley of the Monkeys, to the west of the Valley of the Kings, per Reuters. Egyptologists found 30 workshops apparently used to construct funerary furniture and ornaments, a large kiln, a water storage tank used by workers, and various coffin decorations—including some depicting the wings of god Horus, who's associated with death and resurrection.

"(Apr 23, 2019  10:00 AM CDT) Marking a tire with chalk to track how long a car has been parked is unconstitutional, per a first-of-its-kind ruling that could force cities to adopt new approaches to parking enforcement. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals covering Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee on Monday found tire-chalking is an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, reports the Washington Post. Alison Taylor's lawsuit—brought after she was issued 15 parking tickets in Saginaw, Mich., from 2014 to 2017—was initially dismissed with a US district judge arguing chalk isn't an  information-gathering device,  per NBC News. But while two judges on a three-judge appeals panel agreed that using chalk could be considered a search, all three disagreed it constituted a  reasonable  one, with Judge Bernice Bouie Donald noting tire-chalking was carried out  without probable cause or even so much as 'individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.'  What's more, the  intentional physical contact with Taylor's vehicle  represents a trespass for the purpose of gathering incriminating information, Donald wrote, referencing the 2012 Supreme Court decision that blocked police from attaching GPS devices to vehicles without a warrant. Though the earlier decision had acknowledged an exemption under  community caretaking,  Donald noted there was no justification for a warrantless search as parking violations don't cause  injury or ongoing harm.  The city was essentially raising revenue, she wrote. For some cities, the decision could mean lost revenue or the additional cost of new meters, per the Post.

The FDA allows  compassionate use of unapproved drugs in such cases, but the Chimerix pharmaceutical company had insisted that giving the drug to Josh Hardy, who developed a bone marrow disorder after cancer treatment, would delay efforts to get it to market, CNN reports.

Yale has acquired the 304-page memoir, titled The Life and Adventures of a Haunted Convict, and shed some light on its origins, reports the New York Times. The author is Austin Reed—though he wrote the book as Robert Reed—who was thought to have been born a free man around Rochester. He spent a stretch from the 1830s to the 1850s in prison in nearby Auburn.  Finding any new text by an African-American author of the 19th century is significant, but this memoir has so much to say about captivity, freedom, and human rights,  says a Yale professor getting it ready for publication.  It is a truly remarkable discovery.

"(Apr 26, 2016  5:50 PM CDT) HIV-positive people are aging faster than their HIV-negative peers, putting them at earlier risk of things like dementia, osteoporosis, and heart disease, according to a study published last week in Molecular Cell. Researchers looked at 26,927 DNA tags—called methylation—on the genomes of 137 HIV-positive men; these methylation sites had previously been associated with aging, and in reviewing them, researchers  found a striking association with methylation in the HIV+ patients relative to healthy controls,  they write. Biologist Trey Ideker tells NPR the method used is  better at predicting when someone will die than their chronological age,  and what they found is that men with HIV tended to have a genetic age 4.9 years older than their actual age. Surprisingly, that was true no matter how long the individual had been living with HIV, STAT reports. The nearly five years of advanced aging seen by HIV-positive men corresponds to a 19% increased risk of death. All of the men studied were being treated for HIV, so it's unclear whether it was the HIV or the antiretroviral drugs that accelerated aging. Dr. Howard Fox, the study's lead author, says he hopes the findings will encourage people with HIV to not only stick with treatment but to focus on their health in other ways, such as exercising and maintaining a healthy diet. The findings are also a sign doctors may want to start screening for age-related diseases earlier in patients with HIV. (Charlie Sheen may have actually raised HIV awareness.

The catch? Officials aren't saying which 2,082 people are coming off the list, just as they've never divulged the contents of the list itself, leaving exiles unsure if it is safe to return, the Wall Street Journal reports; many of the exiles the newspaper contacted said that, as far as they knew, they were still banned.  This is a PR move—just like the way they release dissidents,  while leaving others in prison, said one blacklisted economist in London. Until now, the government has largely avoided even acknowledging the list. But today's announcement indicated that it contained a total of 6,165 names.

"(Jul 14, 2015  1:59 PM CDT) To further attempts to impose longer waiting periods and more stringent restrictions, abortion opponents have long used the argument that women suffer negative mental health after undergoing the procedure. That theory may have just been quashed by a new study that indicates 95% of women who've had an abortion felt their decision was the right one—both immediately afterward and three years later, Think Progress reports. In research published in Plos One that tapped data from the Turnaway longitudinal study, scientists from the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health think tank followed 956 women who sought abortions in 21 states and interviewed them every six months for five years. The study is said to be the first in the US to follow women who had abortions (and those denied them) over time, as well as study differences between women who received first-trimester abortions and those who received them later. Not only did the overwhelming majority of women feel OK with their choice to end the pregnancy, but relief was the emotion they felt most after three years. Emotional intensity overall was reduced as time passed, whether those feelings were positive or negative, the study notes. Women who reported the most negative emotions were those who had ended planned pregnancies (i.e., after finding out the fetus had serious health defects) and those who lived in communities where abortion was more stigmatized, Think Progress notes; meanwhile, women who were working or in school while pregnant felt most comfortable with their decision, per the study. Perhaps most surprising, researchers found  no differences in emotional trajectories or decision rightness between women having earlier versus later procedures.

The BBC reports that the Chinese daredevil, known for posting videos of himself at the top of tall buildings scaled without safety devices, is confirmed to have died in a fall from a 62-story building in Changsha on Nov. 8. The South China Morning Post describes the 26-year-old's life-ending stunt as a somewhat selfless act, saying Wu was undertaking the  rooftopping  challenge in hopes of winning $15,000 in prize money in order to pay for his sick mother's medical treatment, and also to fund a wedding with a woman that his step-uncle says he planned to propose to after the challenge was complete. The Telegraph's explanation of the money is that Wu, who had 1 million followers, was trying to secure it by filming himself promoting an unspecified sponsor.

Prosecutor's office rep Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre says the inquiry was launched as an accident investigation, not a terrorism investigation, the AP reports. She says French authorities are  not at all  favoring the theory that the plane was downed deliberately, though the status of the inquiry could eventually change if evidence emerges to that effect.

An Egyptian official at the ministry of civil aviation says Egyptian authorities haven't been notified of the French prosecutor's decision and that all scenarios remain on the table.

"(Oct 17, 2014  12:40 PM CDT) If you've lately found yourself wondering when the worst drought North America has suffered occurred, here's your answer: 1934. At least, as far as the last millennium goes. In a new NASA study, scientists say that a combination of atmospheric conditions (a high pressure ridge off the West Coast that blocked wet weather) and dust storms (the product of grass-eviscerating activities like overfarming and overgrazing that left topsoil susceptible to wind) culminated in the most severe drought in the past 1,000 years. In fact, the Dust Bowl drought of 1934 was so bad that it was 30% worse than the next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580, reports Nature. Scientists drew this conclusion using an analysis of tree rings between the years 1000 and 2005. The 1934 drought extended across 71.6% of Western North America, while the extent of 2012's drought didn't quite reach 60%. As io9 reports, drought led to 14 dust storms in 1932 and 38 in 1933, but farmers kept working the land, expecting rain to return.  As it turns out, the successive dust storms were making the droughts even worse.  NASA explains why:  Dust clouds reflect sunlight and block solar energy from reaching the surface. That prevents evaporation that would otherwise help form rain clouds, meaning that the presence of the dust clouds themselves leads to less rain.  While the agricultural practices that led to those dust storms are no longer used today, scientists say the risk of droughts is only going up, and that agricultural producers will need to adapt accordingly.

Interbank lending rates have fallen since TARP funds have been paid out, but consumer lending remains tight and average credit card rates are virtually unchanged from October 2007, Bloomberg reports.

Right now there is no new lending, and without new lending it’s going to be difficult for the economy to recover,  adds an investment banker.

It was well-meaning advice in the midst of a pandemic. But  that is like telling a dog to stay out of the meat house,  Bryan put it to the Waco Tribune-Herald, which reports he was soon rushed and hugged by his nieces. There were more than two dozen family members and supporters waiting for Bryan, a former high school principal convicted of the 1985 shooting death of his wife in their Clifton home—the subject of a two-part investigation by ProPublica and New York Times Magazine in 2018. The investigation cast doubt on the bloodstain-pattern analysis used to convict him and pointed to a deceased police officer blamed for another murder four months earlier. Bryan, who was attending a conference 120 miles away in Austin, per ProPublica, has always maintained his innocence. His initial conviction was overturned. But he was convicted again in 1989 and sentenced to 99 years.  I think if I had admitted to it, I would have been out years ago,  he told the Tribune-Herald, noting he was first eligible for parole in 1996.  But I didn't do it.

The Treasury secretary under President Obama announced that slave-owning Andrew Jackson, the current occupant of the bill, would be replaced with Tubman by 2020 (though Jackson would remain on the back of the bill). But asked about the plan Thursday on CNBC, Steve Mnuchin, President Trump's Treasury secretary, implied it's far from a sure thing.  Ultimately we will be looking at this issue.

Right now, we've got a lot more important issues to focus on.  Trump himself, while acknowledging Tubman is  fantastic,  has also said he admires Jackson and doesn't want to remove him from the $20 bill. He has mentioned possibly putting Tubman on the $2 bill or a new bill entirely.

It’s not necessarily true that this administration, in the remaining 31 days, I believe, will go back to Congress,  an aide to President Bush said.

US officials hope the bailout will help stabilize Egypt's economy—and keep the longstanding ally from cozying up to countries like Iran.

After a mass civilian trial that began in 2011 and involved 846 defendants, 152 border guards have been sentenced to execution, Reuters and the AP report. Some 161 others are getting life in prison, while 256 have been sentenced to three to 10 years.

Trying hundreds of people en masse in one giant courtroom, where the accused have little or no access to lawyers, is an affront to international legal standards.

They suggested the storm could head toward the US Gulf Coast as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane next week—with a likely forecast track pointing toward Louisiana. Gustav's maximum sustained winds were near 60mph this morning, with higher gusts. The storm was centered about 90 miles west of Port-au-Prince and was moving northwest at 5mph. It was expected to continue moving west-northwest. Forecasters project 120mph winds by this weekend, and Cuban officials have begun relocating people in low-lying areas.","Gustav Kills 11, Weakens","Gustav Kills ____, Weakens",11,Copy( 11 ),0

"(Sep 10, 2020  4:37 PM CDT) An economist is backing a provocative idea on a COVID vaccine: Anyone who gets a shot should receive $1,000 from the government. So argues Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw in a New York Times op-ed. Mankiw is actually writing in support of a proposal first floated by fellow economist Robert Litan at the Brookings Institution. The thinking goes like this: When a vaccine finally arrives, it won't have maximum effect until enough people get a shot to achieve herd immunity. But that means 70% to 90% will need to be vaccinated, and current polls in the US suggest we won't reach that threshold. Solution: Give people a financial incentive to roll up their sleeves for a shot.  Immunology, meet economics,  writes Mankiw.  One of the first principles of economics—perhaps the most important—is that people respond to incentives.  This proposal is  textbook economics,  he writes, delving into the particulars of  positive externalities  and such. It would be a huge expense, somewhere around $300 billion, but that is actually a  bargain  when compared to previous and proposed relief packages, Litan asserts. Mankiw adds that Congress can worry about lowering the government debt once the pandemic subsides. He ends with a suggestion to apply the principle elsewhere:  Perhaps after seeing how a vaccine subsidy can end one crisis, Congress will pay for it by adopting a carbon tax to avert another.

"(Nov 11, 2014  10:19 AM) There were an estimated 1.16 million incidences of murders, rapes, robberies, and other major categories of violent crime last year—the lowest number since 1978's 1.09 million, according to newly released FBI data. The agency's  Crime in the United States  report shows murder and non-negligent manslaughter down 4.4% to 14,196 (the lowest it's been since 1968), with rape down 6.3% and robbery down 2.8%, Reuters reports. The violent crime rate overall, which decreased 5.1% from 2012, has fallen every year since 1994; that 2013 rate of 367.9 per 100,000 people was about half of 1994's. And while the number of murders and violent crimes fell in Detroit, that didn't stop it from being named the most dangerous city in the country, the Detroit News reports. Various factors have been correlated with this steady nationwide reduction in violent crime. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox tells Reuters that an older population, better policing, and more security cameras seem to have had an effect. He also says the ubiquity of cellphones may also play a role:  It's hard for criminals to do anything without being caught on video.  The number of US prisoners has also fallen in tandem with violent crime reduction, falling 6% last year compared to 2008, reports Pew Charitable Trusts, as per Reuters: Thirty-two states have experienced falling crime rates as the imprisonment rate dropped, with California claiming the largest imprisonment-rate reduction (15% over five years) and a crime-rate reduction of 11%.

We do not believe it is reasonable for a 73-year-old insurance executive to be involved in a dangerous undercover sting operation,  they say.

Now, the mother of Navy veteran Ronald Wayne White wants answers. An officer with the DeSoto Police Department tells People the maintenance workers thought there might be a water main issue at the Dallas-area building. Upon finding White's door deadbolted, they forced their way in and on Nov. 12  found the deceased in his kitchen on the floor  in an  advanced  state of decomposition. How advanced brought White's mother, Doris Stevens, to her knees:  for an extended period of time, up to when he was last known alive three years ago,  the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement picked up by NBC News.

Her concerns reached a breaking point in April 2017 when he didn't answer her birthday call. She says she tried to file a missing-person report with the Glenn Heights and Dallas police departments but was told that because he was an adult and abroad so much she couldn't file one, reports WFAA. She says she then traveled to the departments in person from Louisiana several times but wasn't given any  consideration.  She was unaware that her son, who'd recently sold a home in Glenn Heights, was living in the DeSoto apartment; the complex says his bills were paid on time via automatic withdrawal.

Earl Forrest died by injection for the December 2002 deaths of Harriett Smith, Michael Wells, and Dent County Sheriff's Deputy JoAnn Barnes. The 66-year-old Forrest declined to make a final statement. The execution was delayed about an hour, partly because of severe weather in the area. Tornado sirens sounded at one point. As the execution began, Forrest mouthed words to his adult daughter, who was among the witnesses. He stopped speaking within seconds of being injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital, but showed no outward signs of distress, the AP reports.  We know this execution will not bring JoAnn back, but it destroyed an evil person that otherwise would be still walking this earth,  the deputy's family members said in a statement. Forrest's fate was sealed hours earlier when the US Supreme Court refused to halt the execution and Democratic Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon turned down a clemency request.

Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, says the death penalty is withering in the state because fewer people are being sentenced to death.

Poul Nielson, a Danish politician given the task last year of preparing a labor market report for the Nordic Council of Ministers, puts forth  Proposal 7,  which states that the  Nordic governments should commit to the principle of mandatory adult and continuing training for everybody in the labor markets  in that area of the world.  The combination of rapid technological development with the gradual increase in retirement age increases the need for new forms of education,  he tells the EuObserver, noting people in their 60s may still have five to 10 more years in which they'll be collecting a paycheck. And while Nielson says it would be  visionary  for Nordic countries to adopt this proposal, which doesn't define how long or how often adults would have to submit to schooling, he's aware there will be critics and  expects many misgivings, conflicts of interest, and not least major difficulties when it comes to the allocation of costs and rights,  as the Nordic Labour Journal notes. But he points out the creation of a common Nordic workforce in 1954 was a similarly  out of the box  move and that having all adults of working age well-trained will help the region remain competitive globally.

"(Apr 6, 2019  12:45 PM CDT) Determining a winner in the 5G race just gets murkier. On Wednesday, South Korean officials said they had topped the US and China, achieving the first commercial launch of a fifth-generation telecoms network after connecting to a 5G phone. AT&T and Verizon didn't take that well, Reuters reports. AT&T answered later that day, saying it already won when it announced in December that it was kicking off its 5G network in 12 US cities. However, that network can only be accessed by using a mobile hotspot device, not just a 5G phone. Verizon then argued that it was first because it has launched a 5G network that's available only on a new Motorola phone, and only in Chicago and Minneapolis. The stakes are high. The technology is billed as providing data speeds at least 20 times that of 4G and will fuel other advances like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. One estimate has it generating $12.3 trillion in annual revenue across a variety of industries by 2035. But at the moment, 5G is still more talk than reality, per the Verge. AT&T released test results showing its network is fastest, but those results could be misleading. And Verizon's rollout suffers from poor coverage.

Beshear says the group, who  apparently thought they were invincible,  deliberately defied state guidance on social distancing, WTVQ reports.

By comparing genetic markers on 52 modern day Native American populations and 17 Siberian ones, they've concluded that while the Americas were mostly populated in an initial wave 15,000 years ago, two smaller subsequent migrations brought the Eskimos, Aleutians, and the Na-Dene speaking peoples, the Wall Street Journal reports. The three-migration theory was first put forth by linguist Joseph Greenberg in 1987, and has been hotly debated ever since, the New York Times explains. The DNA study is the most comprehensive yet on the topic.  This is monumental work,  says one anthropologist, praising  the enormity of the database and the global approach.

Low ratings and bad press could make trouble with advertisers as well as cable operators, says an analyst at the research and investment firm.  We're expecting a big write-down in the first quarter and we would not be surprised to see Discovery ask Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to finance some of the network's losses going forward,  he tells Broadcasting & Cable.  Without a significant ratings boost by year-end, this could be Oprah Winfrey's last chapter in the cable network industry.  But, the analyst adds, ratings were up in January and Discovery Communications continues to be confident that the situation will improve now that Oprah herself is at the helm full-time. In an email to Deadline, a Discovery spokesperson calls the report  riddled with inaccuracies and bad information,  and insists OWN  is on more solid ground with more business momentum than ever before.",Oprah Winfrey Network Could Lose $143M This Year,Oprah Winfrey Network Could Lose $____M This Year,143,"Round( 142.9 , 0 )",1
"(Jul 19, 2019  6:39 AM CDT) The man accused of setting fire to an anime studio in Japan, killing at least 33 people in one of the country's deadliest postwar mass murders, has been identified as Shinji Aoba. The 41-year-old man is being treated for burns in a hospital and police have so far been unable to question him, reports the BBC. His motive is unclear, though witnesses say they heard him complain that Kyoto Animation had plagiarized his novel before he splashed flammable liquid from a bucket and set it on fire. CCTV footage reportedly shows Aoba buying gas in containers from a nearby station before the attack. Kyoto Animation president Hideaki Hatti says the studio recently received threatening letters, though he doesn't know whether they were from the suspect. Aoba would not have been able to enter the studio building if he had chosen a different day, the Asahi Shimbun reports. Hatti says people normally need ID cards to enter the building, but the system was temporarily deactivated Thursday because of a meeting involving outside guests. Experts say nature of the blaze and the construction of the building—which did not have sprinklers, and wasn't required to under Japan's fire code—may have contributed to the high number of deaths. They say a spiral staircase leading from the first to the third floors would have acted as a  chimney,  causing fire and smoke to spread with terrifying speed. Nineteen bodies were found piled on top of each other on stairs between the third floor and roof; Kyodo reports the door was shut but could reportedly be opened from the roof side. Police say that out of 74 people in the building when the fire broke out, only six escaped uninjured.",19 Bodies Found Piled on Top of Each Other at Anime Studio,____ Bodies Found Piled on Top of Each Other at Anime Studio,19,Copy( 19 ),0

International Organization for Migration staffers found the shallow graves of 29 of the migrants on a beach in Shabwa during a routine patrol, the agency's statement said. The dead were buried by those who survived. At least 22 migrants remained missing, the IOM said. The passengers' average age was around 16, the agency said. The narrow waters between the Horn of Africa and Yemen have been a popular migration route despite Yemen's ongoing conflict, the AP reports.

The survivors told our colleagues on the beach that the smuggler pushed them to the sea when he saw some 'authority types' near the coast,  said Laurent de Boeck, the IOM's chief of mission in Yemen.  They also told us that the smuggler has already returned to Somalia to continue his business and pick up more migrants to bring to Yemen on the same route.  IOM staffers provided aid for 27 surviving migrants who remained on the beach, while other migrants left.

"(Jun 11, 2015  8:56 AM CDT) A Guardian project that's compiling killings by US police says we're right on track to hit more than 1,000 such deaths by year's end, because we've already hit the midpoint. The newspaper's The Counted project, an interactive database that the Guardian says uses both reporting and confirmed crowdsourced info, indicates 500 people have already died at the hands of police in 2015, after two black men in New York and Cincinnati were shot this week. These numbers are more than double the latest rate compiled by the FBI (461 in 2013), which manages a  voluntary  reporting system where police agencies can send in numbers of  justified homicides.  In those first 500 deaths, 49.6% of the individuals were white, 28.2% were black, and 14.8% were Hispanic/Latino. Only 4.8% were women. How that stacks up against America's makeup: As of the 2013 census, we were 62.6% white, 13.2% black, and 17.1% Hispanic/Latino. And there's a definite imbalance among those who were unarmed: Per the paper's stats, 30.5% of black people were unarmed, while just 16.1% of white people were (the unarmed total is 108 of the 500). The executive director of Amnesty International USA told the Guardian earlier this month that the  startling  disparity between unarmed blacks and unarmed whites shows we need to  get to the bottom of why you're twice as likely to be shot if you're an unarmed black male.

"(Feb 18, 2015  12:16 PM) Considering a job at Appster? Sure! Just send in your résumé, spend an average of 15 hours interviewing, and score in the top 5% worldwide on competency tests, and maybe you'll get hired. Fortune reports the Australian app-development company re-engineered its approach after calculating that only about half its hires ended up working out. Fast Company details the current hiring process: It all begins with the company imagining an ideal hire. Then, an HR person sifts through résumés and holds phone interviews; some 10% to 20% of applicants will be sent on to the next step. Some 70% of those people will then be cut in competency tests that require them to score in that top 5% bracket, co-founder Josiah Humphrey tells Fast Company. Next is a half-day interview, followed by an additional three-to-five-hour one. In that second meeting, one of the two interviewers spends the time examining your body language. And you might be asked to come in and do a trial workday. Of course, the team is also investigating your references behind the scenes, and the process involves about 22 hours of work for them per candidate.  You start seeing glimmers of people's personalities they can't hide, things you would never be able to see in a traditional job interview,  co-founder Mark McDonald told Business Insider in November. The goal, he says, is to ensure hires (50 of its 130 employees joined in the past three months) stay on for the long haul, and about 90% now do. A common thread shared by those who get the job? The ability to freely and extensively talk about one's career; Fortune reports this tends to indicate the candidate is qualified and has no skeletons in his or her employment closet.

According to a new study in Australia, parents with at least four children get the most satisfaction out of life despite the chaos and higher expenses, the Daily Signal reports.  With large families, we think they have social support within the family,  study lead Bronwyn Harman tells ABC News Australia.  The kids are never bored, they have someone to play with and they get independence quite early on.  She interviewed 950 parents over a 5-year period to evaluate their happiness level, Yahoo reports, and asked them about self-esteem, social support, and resilience. While parents with big families did have issues—like people asking if the kids had multiple fathers—they were still the most satisfied. Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but  they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate,  she says. Second-happiest (by a razor-thin margin of 0.25%) were LGBT parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, IVF, or adoption.  These children are not accidents ... so the child is very much desired,  says Harmon.

"(May 30, 2018  4:40 PM CDT) Japan says it killed 333 minke whales, including 122 pregnant females, at its controversial annual hunt last summer. The hunt is, as always, under fire for its lack of apparent connection to legitimate scientific research and for killing whales rather than taking a non-lethal survey (Japan says its aim is to show the whale population is healthy). This year's 12-week expedition, in which whales were killed using harpoons fitted with explosives, has also been particularly criticized for the number of pregnant females that were killed. Of the 128 mature females killed, 95.3% were pregnant, reports the Guardian. The expedition was detailed in a report to the International Whaling Commission.  The killing of 122 pregnant whales is a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of Japan’s whale hunt,  a Humane Society International program manager says in a statement. Whether Japan’s whale hunts are legal is a bit murky, notes the New York Times. Under a 1946 international ruling, countries may kill whales for scientific research. In 2014, an international court found Japan's whale hunt was for commercial purposes, not scientific, and temporarily banned the country from whaling in the Antarctic Ocean; a year later Japan began a new program that reduced the number of whales it kills by two-thirds and that, per Japan, has a scientific purpose. But experts contend the new program is still for profit; the whale meat is eventually sold as food.  They’ve sought to exploit this loophole,  one legal expert tells the NYT. Japan says that aside from research purposes, whale hunting is an important part of its culture, notes the BBC. Other countries still hunt whales for meat, but only Japan hunts whales in Antarctica under the scientific research exemption.

Many are hoping to see more fight from an administration widely viewed as spineless.  He needs to start stomping his foot and pounding the desk,  says a member of the Democratic National Committee. But White House officials have brushed off many of those criticisms, dismissing them as out of step with mainstream opinions. But many of the party faithful insist it's time to wake up:  The alarms have already gone off in the Democratic grass roots,  said another DNC member.

"(Jan 7, 2018  4:31 PM) Columnist Nicholas Kristof looks back on the state of the world in the year that just ended and arrives at a conclusion likely to surprise many:  2017 was probably the very best year in the long history of humanity,  he writes in the New York Times. It's all about perspective, Kristof explains. Yes, American politics are a  circus,  North Korea poses a scary threat, and wars and related atrocities continue to plague Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, and elsewhere. But it's important to look past the drumbeat of bad news and not lose sight of bigger-picture advancements, including:  A smaller share of the world’s people were hungry, impoverished or illiterate than at any time before. A smaller proportion of children died than ever before.  Kristof is talking about  transformational  changes taking place over years, even decades, that get lost in daily headlines, including advances in health care in third-world nations and the increasing availability of clean water and electricity. Kristof writes that he isn't blind to the very real threats the world is facing, but he suggests looking at this way:  The world is registering important progress, but it also faces mortal threats. The first belief should empower us to act on the second.

"(Jun 2, 2013  2:02 PM CDT) A new book by journalist Edward Klein says Obama has been pushed into supporting a 2016 presidential run by Hillary Clinton. Obama offered the endorsement in exchange for Bill Clinton's enthusiastic nominating speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, writes Klein in an extract of The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House published in the New York Post. The deal was allegedly struck in spite of a history of animosity between the two presidents.  Obama doesn’t know how to be president. He doesn’t know how the world works. He’s incompetent. He’s an amateur!  Klein quotes Bill as saying privately, via a source. But after the convention, Klein says Obama cooled to the idea of offering Hillary his endorsement, deciding he'd rather stay neutral.  Bill Clinton went ballistic and threatened retaliation,  writes Klein.  Obama backed down. He called his favorite journalist, Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes, and offered an unprecedented 'farewell interview' with departing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The result was a slobbering televised love-in—and an embarrassment to all concerned.  But, says Klein, Obama may renege on his promise yet. And  as Obama’s presidency sinks deeper into scandal and inaction, the question is—will Clinton even still want his endorsement?

"(Dec 12, 2015  11:30 AM) There has yet to be a confirmed US collision between a drone and a manned aircraft, but there's a growing number of close calls as drones fly where they least belong—near airports. A report released Friday counted at least 241 reports of close encounters between drones and manned aircraft that meet the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of a near-collision, including 28 incidents in which pilots had to veer out of the way. The analysis by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone found that 90 of the close drone encounters involved commercial jets. The FAA defines a near-collision as two aircraft flying within 500 feet of each other. In 51 of the incidents studied, the drone-to-aircraft clearance was 50 feet or less, the report said. Most of the sightings occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet. Those are spaces in which the FAA prohibits drones from flying, raising questions about the effectiveness of the rules. The cities with the most incidents were New York, Newark, Los Angeles, and Miami. The report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that it's hard for pilots to judge their distance from another object when flying at high speeds. The majority of the incidents, 64%, were sightings of drones in the vicinity of other aircraft with no immediate threat of collision. The Bard report is the first comprehensive analysis of the sightings by researchers outside the aviation community.","Report: 90 'Near Collisions' Between Drones, Commercial Jets","Report: ____ 'Near Collisions' Between Drones, Commercial Jets",90,Copy( 90 ),0

The strange story comes out of Tuba City, Arizona, where a group of friends rigged a GoPro camera, a camcorder, and a Samsung Galaxy Note II phone to a weather balloon to record shots of the Grand Canyon in 2013. All was well until they tried to use the Note's GPS to retrieve their carefully made package after it returned to solid ground.  The problem was that the coverage map we were relying on (looking at you, AT&T) was not accurate, so the phone never got signal as it came back to Earth, and we never heard from it,  one of the friends explains on Reddit. Two years later, an AT&T employee happened upon the bundle during a hike, about 50 miles from where the friends launched it, and took it to a retail store. AT&T was able to identify the Note's owner using the phone's SIM card.  We got the footage and data a few weeks later!  the Reddit user exclaims.

"(May 16, 2017  8:42 AM CDT) In April, the UN Population Fund was one of the first under the  Mexico City policy  to lose US funds for allegedly participating in or supporting  coercive  abortions in China. Now that policy is being extended, with an announcement Monday from the State Department that more US funds will be withdrawn worldwide, affecting around $8.8 billion in health funding and pulling resources away from clinics that combat AIDS and malaria (among other issues), especially in Africa, the New York Times reports. Any international nongovermental groups wanting US financial assistance will now have to sign off on the  Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance  mandate, per NBC News. The State Department says any funds that are taken away from one group will be redistributed to others that agree to the terms, keeping the foreign aid level relatively the same. The expanded mandate means groups who want US money must not  promote abortion as a method of family planning.  The gag rule ups the amount being affected from between $520 million and $600 million under former President George W. Bush to about $8.8 billion, with public health advocates noting funding will be severed in places that need it most, such as West Africa.  Whole communities could be cut off,  one advocate tells the Times.

Researchers at the University of Utah gave mice a diet of 25% sugar—equivalent to three extra sodas per day in people—and found the males less likely to reproduce or defend their territory, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Females had it worse, dying at double their normal rate. And to think, the National Research Council tells us that this level of added sugar is considered safe in humans.  Added sugar consumed at concentrations currently considered safe exerts dramatic adverse impacts on mammalian health,  the study says, according to Science Daily. Yet the mice weren't fatter and would have passed physicals, despite the negative health impacts—so the sugar's toxic damage is all  under the hood.  Why rely on a study of mice? They're considered roughly equivalent to humans in dietary studies because they've had a similar diet to ours for about 10,000 years, and up to 80% of what's toxic to them is toxic to people, too.",3 Extra Sodas Per Day Can Kill You,____ Extra Sodas Per Day Can Kill You,3,Trans( three ),1

Homeless advocacy group Ktown For All highlighted the move in a Monday tweet, noting 504 residents scheduled to visit the Union Station Kiosk site on Tuesday had appointments canceled at the last minute. Curative, the company that operates the site, apparently felt the film shoot would be disruptive and make social distancing a challenge, per Deadline. But neither Mayor Eric Garcetti nor FilmLA, which processes film permit applications, were aware of the closure, per the Washington Post.  All we know at this hour is that this decision wasn't made by FilmLA or the City's film permit approver LAPD, nor was it sought by the production company,  a FilmLA rep told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. Mirimax ultimately requested that Curative allow testing, as filming won't take place near the site on the South Patio of Union Station, a source tells the Times. By early Tuesday, Garcetti announced the site, which accounts for about 1.5% of the city's total daily tests, would reopen.

Inverted Jenny  stamps are considered the most famous in America: A printing accident in 1918 produced a single sheet of 100 of the stamps, each featuring an upside-down Curtiss JN-4H biplane, NPR explains. In 1955, someone swiped a block of four from the collection of Ethel Stewart McCoy, whose father was a Dow Jones founder. It is  one of the most notorious crimes in philatelic history,  Scott English, administrator of the American Philatelic Research Library, tells the AP. The stamp was submitted this month to New York auction house Spink USA by an unnamed man in his 20s who hails from the UK and says he inherited it from his grandfather; it's unclear if he knew it was stolen. A press release from Spink USA states that the inverted Jenny was  determined to be position 76 in the pane of 100 subjects —the one in the bottom right of the block of four stolen. Identification took some sleuthing: In a long-ago attempt to disguise it, the stamp  had been reperforated at right and most of the gum was removed, so the pencil position numbers written on the gummed side had been lost.  Positions 75 and 65 turned up in 1958 and 1982, respectively, and the new discovery leaves only one of the four stolen stamps unaccounted for. (In 2014, a dealer offered a $50,000 reward for the missing inverted Jennies.)

"(Jul 16, 2012  3:49 AM CDT) Sea piracy worldwide fell by 54% in the first half of 2012, led by a dramatic drop in Somali piracy, according to an international maritime watchdog. The International Maritime Bureau attributed the sharp drop to  pre-emptive and disruptive counter piracy tactics  by international navies patrolling in seas off Somalia as well as increased vigilance by ships, more of which now have private armed personnel on board. The bureau said 177 attacks were reported worldwide from January to June, down from 266 in the same period last year. It said 20 vessels were hijacked worldwide, with 334 crew members taken hostage and at least four crew members killed. Attacks off Somalia's coast plunged to 69 in the first half of this year, down from 163 over the same period a year ago, it said. Somali pirates also hijacked fewer vessels with 13 seized, down from 21.  The naval actions play an essential role in frustrating the pirates.

"(Oct 19, 2017  4:54 PM CDT) On Thursday, President Trump gave himself perfect marks for the federal government's response to the ongoing disaster in Puerto Rico, USA Today reports.  I'd say it was a 10,  Trump told reporters during a meeting with Gov. Ricardo Rossello of Puerto Rico. According to the Washington Post, Trump called rendering aid to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria  probably the most difficult  disaster response in history.  It was in many ways worse than anything people have ever seen,  the president said, adding,  It was worse than Katrina.  (Trump has previously said Hurricane Maria wasn't a  real catastrophe  like Katrina.) Trump said the response in Puerto Rico has been hampered by damaged ports and roadways, already-poor infrastructure, and  corruption on the island.  Rossello was also asked to give his assessment of the government's response to Maria—specifically by Trump, who wanted to know,  Did we do a great job?   You responded immediately, sir,  Rossello answered. The governor also tried to deflect some of the criticism away from Trump, the Guardian reports.  We didn’t have the ports open for a couple of days,  Rossello said.  We didn’t have the airports open at full capacity until about a day or two ago.  Recent polls show the rest of the US might not share Trump's optimistic assessment of the situation in Puerto Rico. One poll found less than a third of the country approved of his handling of relief efforts; in another poll, 36% of people said Trump hadn't done enough for Puerto Rico, where more than one-third of houses still lack running water and less than a fifth of the power grid has been restored.",Trump on Puerto Rico Response: 'I'd Say It Was a 10',Trump on Puerto Rico Response: 'I'd Say It Was a ____',10,Copy( 10 ),0

According to court reports, three of four of the men, who are all rugby players with the Royal Regiment of Scotland, started beating on the rookie cop when he began talking to a woman who was with the soldiers, the Guardian reports.

One of the soldiers allegedly grabbed the man's phone and a chain from around his neck when he tried to call 911. The brawl reportedly moved out into the street, leaving blood splattered along the block, until the cop pulled out a knife and slashed one of the soldiers, the Daily Mail reports. When the victim identified himself as a policeman, the soldiers allegedly responded,  We don't care. F*** the police.

Her first secretary of state, a man who the BBC reports is essentially her deputy and who the Guardian notes was brought  into Downing Street after her majority was wiped out in June's general election to help shore up her authority,  is out after it emerged he lied about porn found on his work computer nearly a decade ago. In November, the Sunday Times reported on the  extreme  porn discovered on the computer in Damian Green's parliamentary office in 2008; Green was unequivocal in his response, branding the allegations  false, disreputable political smears.  An investigation was launched by the cabinet secretary, and it was determined that Green did not adhere to the  seven principles of public life —one is honesty—as required by the ministerial code. The lying doesn't relate to how the porn got there, but to Green's assertion that he was unaware it had been found during a police investigation of government leaks, reports the AP. In his resignation letter, Green allowed that  I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013.  He reiterated that he did not  download or view  the porn.

Authorities previously declared that it looked like an inside job, though owner/chef Thomas Keller said that didn't mean much: It  could have been the linen delivery guys, the wine delivery guys, and any of the people who service the restaurant, as well as everybody who ever worked at one of our restaurants over the years.

"(Jan 5, 2011  3:02 AM) Gerry Rafferty, the Scottish singer/songwriter best known for '70s hits  Baker Street  and  Stuck in the Middle With You,  has died at the age of 63 after a long battle with alcoholism and liver disease. Baker began his career busking on the London Underground before teaming up with Billy Connolly to form folk duo the Stumblebums. He later formed soft rock group Stealer's Wheel before launching a solo career. Rafferty made more than $100,000 a year in royalties from  Baker Street,  a song about his unhappiness with stardom, which, ironically, brought him even more fame, notes BBC presenter Paul Gambaccini. Rafferty  just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it,  Gambaccini says.  Thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. Now we have this unhappy end.

"(Jun 14, 2016  5:35 PM CDT) When the staff at London's highbrow Southbank International school heard former teacher William Vahey had died of a heart attack, tears were shed. The reality was infinitely darker: Vahey took his own life with a stab wound to the chest in the bathtub of a Minnesota Quality Inn on March 21, 2014. The next month, the FBI revealed the married father of two sons was believed to be one of the most prolific pedophiles it had ever dealt with, one who was able to drug and abuse male pupils at international schools in eight countries over his 42-year career with impunity. Now, the Guardian's five-month investigation into the case reveals  evidence that, if properly explored,  could have stopped Vahey, convicted as a pedophile in the US at age 20—something all the background checks missed. At schools in places like Indonesia he would lead the travel club, taking students to far-flung locations where invariably some of the boys would fall sick—drugged by Vahey; he would insist on watching over them, in his room or theirs. A fellow chaperone recalls being likely drugged and how insistent Vahey was that no one touch his camera. A man who at age 14 had sleepovers with Vahey's sons at their Jakarta home recalls being given drug-laced Oreos and the  eating race  Vahey would suggest to get the boys to gobble them down. His parents went to an administrator who now denies being told about the cookies specifically. The Guardian suggests Vahey's wife's prominent position within the international schools community may have made some hesitant to speak up about their suspicions for fear of damage to their careers. Things only began to unravel when Vahey's maid stole his flashdrive, which held photos of naked and partially clad boys—some 90 of them—and turned it over to the American Nicaraguan School in November 2013.

Teresa Klein, 53, made the accusation in a 911 call, saying the child  grabbed  her and then his mother  decided to yell at me.  The scene unfolded in a Facebook video that's been seen over five million times as of this writing, the New York Post reports. But Klein didn't back down, and amid a firestorm of social-media criticism returned to Sahara Deli Market on Friday to watch security footage of the alleged groping. People jammed the store's doorway and aimed their cell cameras at Klein as footage played on a ceiling-mounted TV: It showed the boy brushing Klein's behind with his backpack as she leaned over the counter. Klein later apologized in a media interview, saying,  Young man, I don’t know your name but I’m sorry.  But she denied being racist and still grumbled about the boy's mother getting aggressive with her. Meanwhile, Twitter feeds have dubbed her #CornerstoreCaroline, a reference to other recent, dubious accusations by white people about black behavior (another accuser was called #BBQBecky).

"(Feb 2, 2014  11:56 PM) The American abortion rate has dropped to its lowest level since 1973's landmark Roe v. Wade decision—and the fall appears to have a lot more to do with contraception and the economy than with state laws restricting abortion, a new study finds. Researchers say there were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2011, down a full 13% from 2008 and only slightly higher than the rate after abortion was legalized in all 50 states 40 years ago, the Washington Post reports. The abortion rate has been in long-term decline from a peak of almost 30 per 1,000 women in 1981, though the fall stalled in the middle of the last decade, notes the New York Times. The study's lead author says the decline is probably linked to the overall decline in pregnancy rates that happened during the recession, along with the growing use of near-foolproof long-term contraceptives like intrauterine devices. Anti-abortion activists, however, say the drop shows their lobbying efforts are working. The decline  shows that women are rejecting the idea of abortion as the answer to an unexpected pregnancy,  the president of the National Right to Life Committee tells the AP.",Abortion Rate Hasn't Been This Low Since 1973,Abortion Rate Hasn't Been This Low Since ____,1973,Copy( 1973 ),0

A sharecropper's son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a House committee that investigated President Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of the president's governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House, the AP reports. Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.  I was devastated,  Cummings the AP in 1996.  My whole life changed. I became very determined.  It steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong.

The Library of Congress conducted the first comprehensive survey of silent films over the past two years and found that 70% are believed to be lost. Of the nearly 11,000 silent feature films made in America between 1912 and 1930, the survey found that only 14% still exist in their original format. About 11% of the films that survive exist only as foreign versions or on lower-quality formats. Notable films now considered lost include Cleopatra from 1917, the Great Gatsby from 1926, Lon Chaney's London After Midnight from 1927, and The Patriot from 1928. Films featuring early stars, including Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Mary Pickford still exist. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Library of Congress, and other archives have been preserving early films for decades.

But now explorer Ranulph Fiennes is leading a six-man attempt to do just that, spending six months to cross the icy continent on a trek dubbed The Coldest Journey, reports the Guardian. Leaving London yesterday, the expedition is set to begin the Antarctic crossing on March 21, with hopes of raising $10 million for fighting blindness, while performing scientific research along their journey. Fiennes has already survived a heart attack while climbing Everest, sawed off the tips of his own frostbitten fingers, and beaten cancer. But surviving temperatures that could drop as low as minus-133 degrees is unprecedented.

The Spillers and Bakers Pilot biscuit, which made its way into a survival kit on one of the lifeboats that April night in 1912 when the ship went under, was sold Monday at a UK auction house for $23,000, give or take a few crumbs, per UPI. A photo of the iceberg that doomed the Titanic was also sold, for just over $32,000.  It is incredible that this biscuit has survived such a dramatic event—the sinking of the world's largest ocean liner—costing 1,500 lives,  auctioneer Andrew Aldridge of Henry Aldridge & Son tells the Salisbury Journal. The cracker had been salvaged by one James Fenwick, a passenger on the RMS Carpathia, the boat that went to the aid of Titanic passengers that night, per the Journal. Fenwick kept the cracker in a Kodak photo envelope with a note that read:  Pilot biscuit from Titanic lifeboat April 1912.  Other expensive crackers Aldridge is aware of include one from one of Ernest Shackleton's adventures (that one went for about $4,500, Aldridge notes) and one from the Lusitania, now safe in an Irish museum and said to be valued at between $12,000 and $15,000—making Aldridge confident that he could proclaim the Titanic cracker  the most valuable biscuit in the world.  One more item that got snatched up at the auction: a  loving cup,  sold for nearly $200,000 (which makes it the third most-expensive Titanic artifact ever, per the Journal), presented to the captain of the Carpathia by survivor Molly Brown using donations from wealthy survivors of the tragedy.

The Oklahoma Department of Corrections describes the Saturday afternoon incident at the Cimarron Correctional Facility as a  disturbance  and says staff members in the area responded very quickly, NBC News reports. Officials say the incident, which happened as medium-security inmates were being let out to the exercise yard, left three men dead from stab wounds on Saturday and a fourth man died from his wounds overnight, reports the AP, which notes that up to 300 inmates were involved in a massive brawl at the same facility in June. It's not clear what sparked the violence at the prison operated by Corrections Corporation of America, which the Wall Street Journal notes is America's largest private prison operator. The 1,720-bed facility was locked down after the incident, and officials say that as a precaution, all other prisons in the state are also on lockdown, the AP reports. The AP also notes that with a homicide rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates, compared to an average of 4 per 100,000 nationwide, Oklahoma has the highest prison murder rate in the country.",4 Killed in 'Disturbance' at Private Prison,____ Killed in 'Disturbance' at Private Prison,4,Copy( 4 ),0

But some troubling new statistics show that a lot of ground has been lost in the fight against STDs, and it's affecting some of the most vulnerable members of society. According to a new CDC report, 918 babies were born with syphilis in the US in 2017, the Guardian reports. That's a 20-year high. For context, there were 628 cases of syphilis in infants in 2016. In 2013, there were 362. Of the 2017 cases, 77 resulted in stillbirths or newborn deaths, per USA Today. Western and southern states had the most cases of congenital syphilis in 2017, per the report, with Louisiana having the highest rate.  It's just a systematic public health failure. It's shocking that this has come roaring back in the United States,  David Harvey of the National Coalition of STD Directors tells the Guardian. Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics, and women can be treated while they are pregnant to prevent the disease from being passed on to their child. But, per the Guardian, some women do not get tested, and others contract the disease while pregnant after testing negative. In some cases, there is a connection to drug use. Overall, there were 30,644 syphilis diagnoses in the US in 2017—up 76% from the year before.",Cases of Syphilis in Infants Are at 20-Year High,Cases of Syphilis in Infants Are at ____-Year High,20,Copy( 20 ),0

"(Jan 10, 2012  10:51 AM) The AP turned some heads yesterday when it reported that Tim Cook might have been the highest paid CEO in America in 2011, with total pay worth some $378 million. But the key word in that sentence is  might,  notes Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune. It's still not chump change, but all Apple actually gave Cook last year was a $900,017 salary and a $14,700 contribution to his 401(K). The hundreds of millions more come from restricted stock units he was given upon promotion. Half of those shares don't vest until 2016, and the other half don't until 2021, so if Cook flames out at Apple, his 2011 payday could look pretty modest indeed. But the SEC requires companies to report share grants as compensation in the year they're given, so lots of reporters are referring to $378 million as Cook's  total compensation.  But if Cook really makes that much,  you could argue that he was worth it,  Elmer-DeWitt writes.",2011's Top-Paid CEO: Apple's Tim Cook*,____'s Top-Paid CEO: Apple's Tim Cook*,2011,Copy( 2011 ),0

The Guardian reports that the then-4-year-old, who lived with her elderly grandparents in a remote wooded area in Russia's Tuva Republic, found her 60-year-old grandmother not responding last month. Her grandfather, who's blind, couldn't venture out for help, and so Saglana grabbed a box of matches and headed out into the minus-29-degree weather to try to get to the nearest neighbor's house about 5 miles away. The Siberian Times notes Saglana had gone on walks with her grandmother in the past and recalled that even though there was no road, if she followed the river, she'd eventually hit the neighbor's house. She waded through snow that was sometimes chest-deep, luckily avoiding any resident wolves.  She could have easily stumbled on a pack in the darkness,  the local rescue group's head tells the Guardian. One of the neighbors at her destination spotted Saglana as she walked past (she apparently couldn't see the house through the weeds) and phoned for help. Sadly, when medical staff rushed to Saglana's home, it was discovered her grandmother had died of a heart attack—and in more bad news, Tuva officials have opened a criminal probe into her mom for leaving Saglana with her elderly grandparents, who may have not been able to properly care for her.

Apparently $100 million—or more than $6,400 per hour—If that estate belongs to Leona Helmsley, the Wall Street Journal reports.  By any definition, this hourly rate is exorbitant, unreasonable, and improper,  states a filing from the New York Attorney General's Office. The executors of Helmsley's will—two grandchildren, a lawyer, and a business advisor—defended their request for the  astronomical  fee stating they  faced enormous risks  while increasing the estate's value. Helmsley—a famous New York City property owner who KCCI points out was known as the  Queen of Mean —was worth $4.78 billion when she died in 2007, the Journal reports.

Well, keep wondering, but an excerpt from an unreleased Japanese documentary has Kubrick explaining the film's mysterious ending, BoingBoing reports.  I've tried to avoid doing this ever since the picture came out. When you just say the ideas they sound foolish, whereas if they’re dramatized one feels it, but I'll try,  the famed director of Dr. Strangelove and The Shining tells TV personality Jun'ichi Yaio in a phone call.  The idea was supposed to be that [the astronaut played by actor Keir Dullea] is taken in by god-like entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time.  After discussing the  deliberately  inaccurate French architecture of the room in the closing scene, Kubrick says that  when they get finished with him, as happens in so many myths of all cultures in the world, he is transformed into some kind of super being and sent back to Earth, transformed and made into some sort of superman. We have to only guess what happens when he goes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest.

The fine is the first time Brussels has punished a company for breaching a settlement, and the EU’s competition authority said the size of the fine was designed to  punish and deter,  noting companies  must do what they committed to do or face the consequences.

Jerry Brown has pardoned five refugees from Cambodia and another immigrant from Honduras who faced the possibility of deportation because of their criminal convictions, the AP reports. The pardons were among more than 250 clemency decisions announced by the governor on Christmas Eve. According to Brown's office, the five Cambodians entered the country when they were 5 or younger. The pardons don't automatically stop deportation proceedings, but they eliminate the state convictions on which federal authorities might base deportation decisions. That gives the men's lawyers strong legal arguments before immigration judges to try to prevent their removal from the country.","For Over 250 Prisoners, It Really Is Christmas","For Over ____ Prisoners, It Really Is Christmas",250,Copy( 250 ),0
"(Aug 16, 2017  7:23 PM CDT) Police are begging for information from the public regarding the horrific murder of a 12-year-old girl in her family's mobile home last week in Tennessee. Fox 17 reports Yhoana Arteaga was on crutches and stuck at home in Goodlettsville last Thursday, having injured her leg in a skating accident the day before. According to WKRN, Yhoana's mother says her daughter texted her around 5:30pm to let her know someone was knocking on the door. She says she returned home from work a little over an hour later to find her daughter dead. Police, who are keeping some details private, say Yhoana died from blunt force trauma and her clothing  was in disarray,  the Tennessean reports.  This is a horrible, brutal thing,  Sgt. David Kautzman says.  I’ve never seen anything this brutal in my entire career.  So far, police have received fewer tips than is typical with this type of crime, and police have few leads.  We believe there are persons in this community who have knowledge of a person who may be responsible for this,  police spokesperson Don Aaron says.  Please, for the family’s sake, for the sake of this 12-year-old deceased girl, let us know.  Police say they believe Yhoana knew her killer, and they do have a number of persons of interest—though they are not identifying them.

In a foreword to the report, Bill Clinton said that  we are still struggling to provide equal opportunity  to children and urged the first federal study of school buildings in almost two decades. The Center for Green Schools' researchers reviewed spending and estimates that schools spent $211 billion on upkeep between 1995 and 2008. During that time, schools should have spent some $482 billion, the group calculated. That left a $271 billion gap between what should have been spent on upkeep and what was—or $5,450 per student, the group reported. To update the buildings, the figure doubles, to $542 billion over the next decade.  When we talk about a quality education, we talk about the 'who' and the 'what'— teachers and curriculum—but we don't talk about the 'where.'

By contrast, the combined bailouts of financial companies and the auto industry have cost taxpayers roughly $50 billion, and the bailouts of Wall Street banks alone, which sparked public fury, have so far brought taxpayers a $16 billion return. Fannie and Freddie could end up costing taxpayers between $142 billion and $259 billion through 2013, the Federal Housing Finance Agency projected today. Those figures take into account dividends that the agency estimates the two companies will end up paying the government: between $80 billion and $104 billion over the next three years.

Russell Taylor was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty to child exploitation and child porn charges. The 44-year-old Indianapolis man agreed in September to plead guilty and admitted using hidden cameras to produce pornography of 12 children. Taylor was executive director of a nonprofit Fogle started to fight childhood obesity. Prosecutors say Fogle received photos or videos from Taylor of eight of Taylor's 12 child victims.

Samson, 50, gave her address as 4205 North Creal St., instead of 4025. The incorrect address didn't come up in police systems, and Samson's phone didn't have  smart 911  that enabled authorities to track it. The 1:20am call got disconnected, and Samson managed to call back three times. She repeated the 4205 address, and her last call was interrupted by screams and gunshots. When police got to North Creal Street and figured out the correct address, about 15 minutes after the initial call, they found her shot to death and her husband, George Samson, dead in the basement of a self-inflicted gunshot. The couple had been married the previous night, and guests reported that an argument between them at the reception continued at a get-together at their house afterward.

The next morning, on Nov. 1, 1980, a passing trucker spotted her body on the side of the highway, reports ABC13. Likely aged 15 to 20, the girl was naked and had been strangled. Not only could police not find her killer, but no one at Ellis Prison Farm could identify the girl—who was white, five and a half feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes—and an investigation that followed offered no clues about who she might be. Now, Sheriff Clint McRae and the Walker County Sheriff's Office hope that sharing the few facts they have will lead to new information. Authorities say the girl—last seen wearing jeans, a yellow shirt, a white knit sweater, a rectangular brown stone pendant on a gold chain, and leather sandals—first visited a gas station on the city's south side, where workers gave her directions to Ellis Prison Farm. She left on foot, eventually arriving at a truck stop on I-45 on the north side of Huntsville. There, she again asked for directions, which employees wrote down. When they asked if the girl's parents knew her whereabouts, she said,  Who cares?  She did, however, say she was from the Rockport and Aransas Pass area about 260 miles away, per the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, though no one there could identify her.

"(Aug 12, 2014  1:03 PM CDT) The first study of its kind shows that newborns' brains grow fast—figure a staggering 1% a day immediately after birth, though it slows to about half that rate by the end of three months. Using MRI scans of 87 newborns' brains, researchers discovered that the first weeks of life see the fastest growth—those little brains grow by 64% in three months. The cerebellum, responsible for movement, grows the fastest and the memory-forming hippocampus the slowest, LiveScience reports. Researchers from UC San Diego and the University of Hawaii took more than 200 MRI scans of full-term and preemie babies, starting when the kids were just 2 days old. The scans found that preemies' brains are 2% smaller than average at the end of 90 days, suggesting that medically unnecessary induced labor can stunt a baby’s brain development, says UC San Diego's Dominic Holland.  The brains of premature babies actually grow faster than those of term-born babies, but that's because they're effectively younger—and younger means faster growth,  he adds. Researchers say using MRI or CT scans will prove to be a much more effective way to track development. Scans should lead to more exact growth charts—replacing the old method of measuring the skull with measuring tape—and help identify disorders such as autism or brain injury early. Researchers plan to look further into how alcohol and drug use during pregnancy affects brain development.

Arlene Magdanz, a San Francisco-area substitute teacher, is now officially a millionaire seven times over thanks to a dead first cousin. The AP reports that a crew cleaning out Walter Samaszko Jr.'s home found ammunition boxes in the 69-year-old's garage filled with thousands of gold coins, worth $7.4 million. The haul was so huge that the public administrator of the estate borrowed a neighbor's wheelbarrow to cart the treasure out—and filled the wheelbarrow twice. Officials tracked down Magdanz using a funeral bulletin at Samaszko's home that led to his father's service in Chicago in the early 1960s, and then newspaper clippings that listed survivors. It's unclear what Samaszko did for a living, or where the money used to buy the gold came from; his mother, who lived with him until her death in 1992, may have actually been the one to purchase it.

The Local reports that authorities have scoured the area, using helicopters, police dogs, divers, and cavers around France’s southeastern Isère region to track down any trace of Maelys De Araujo. After canines lost the girl’s scent in the venue’s parking lot, police believe kidnapping is a possibility, though they are not ruling out other explanations,  accidental or criminal,  for her disappearance.

He added,  We initially thought she must be asleep in a corner after a game of hide-and-seek.  Police were contacted an hour later when the search yielded no results, the Guardian reports. All of the 180 wedding guests were interviewed by police, who are now reviewing photos and videos from the celebration and conducting 70 additional interviews of people who attended outside social events at a local bar and community hall around the same time.","Search Underway After French Girl, 9, Vanishes at Wedding","Search Underway After French Girl, ____, Vanishes at Wedding",9,Copy( 9 ),0
"(May 10, 2017  12:03 AM CDT) For weeks Seattle Mayor Ed Murray pushed ahead with plans for his re-election campaign despite claims by men he sexually abused them decades ago when they were teenagers, allegations Murray vehemently denied. But Murray announced Tuesday he was abandoning his bid for a second term, saying it would be best for the city, the AP reports.  It tears me to pieces to step away, but I believe it's in the best interest of this city that I love,  said Murray, 62, flanked by his husband and tearful supporters. He said he'll serve out his term through the end of this year. The mayor, a Democrat, said he was proud of his accomplishments, including raising Seattle's minimum wage to $15. Murray reiterated his denial of the allegations that first emerged last month when a man filed a lawsuit claiming Murray paid him for sex in the 1980s. Three other men also came forward with similar allegations, including one who is jailed on drug charges.  The allegations against me are not true,  Murray said.  And I say this with all honesty and with the deepest sincerity. But the scandal surrounding them and me is hurting this city.  Murray, who became a frequent, high-profile critic of President Trump after last year's election, has previously claimed the allegations were part of an anti-gay conservative campaign to oust him, but he didn't repeat those accusations during his speech.","After Abuse Claims, Seattle Mayor Won't Seek 2nd Term","After Abuse Claims, Seattle Mayor Won't Seek ____nd Term",2,Trans( second ),1

It feels like a part of my kids’ childhood is back, part of our family is back.  Abby, a black lab mix, wandered off from Suierveld's home in Pennsylvania 10 years ago, and the family searched for their missing pup to no avail, the Valley News Dispatch reports. But last weekend Abby showed back up like nothing had happened. Suierveld says Abby still answers to her name and even remembers the commands she and her daughter taught her. Suierveld says her now-22-year-old daughter cried when she heard Abby had, improbably, returned home. Judy Spiering called Animal Protectors of Allegheny Valley on Jan. 27 when a friendly but very thirsty black lab mix turned up on her porch 10 miles from the Suierveld home in Apollo. A microchip in Abby's neck led to Suierveld's vet, who had Abby listed as deceased, and then to Suierveld. Suierveld couldn't believe it.  I didn't even know what to say,  she says, adding,  She kind of came back from the dead.  But no one can figure out where Abby has spent the past decade.  She's a good weight.

But Eric Abramovitz never saw the acceptance email because then-girlfriend Jennifer Lee, a fellow music student, was spying on his account and saw it first, a court heard this week. According to Abramovitz's lawsuit, Lee, fearing she would lose him if he moved away from Montreal, posed as Abramovitz to send an email declining the offer, the Montreal Gazette reports. After deleting the original email, she then allegedly set up a fake email account in Gilad's name and sent a rejection notice to Abramovitz, who was sharing her apartment at the time. Abramovitz—who finished his degree in Montreal but split up with Lee later in 2014 for unrelated reasons—ended up studying part-time under Gilad two years later and discovered the deception after the world-renowned teacher asked why he had rejected him. The student realized Lee was to blame when he correctly guessed the password to the account that had sent him the fake rejection notice. A judge in Ontario, calling Lee's conduct  despicable,  awarded Abramovitz $266,000, CTV reports. The judge said the figure included damages for  the incompensable personal loss suffered by Mr. Abramovitz by having a closely held personal dream snatched from him by a person he trusted.

"(Aug 17, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) Actor Peter Fonda, the son of a Hollywood legend who became a movie star in his own right after both writing and starring in the counter-culture classic  Easy Rider,  has died. His family said in a statement that Fonda died Friday morning at his home in Los Angeles, per the AP. He was 79. The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer.  I am very sad,  Jane Fonda said in a statement.  He was my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing.  Born into Hollywood royalty as Henry Fonda's only son, Peter Fonda carved his own path with his non-conformist tendencies and earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the psychedelic road-trip movie Easy Rider. He never won that golden statuette, but he was later nominated for his turn as a Vietnam veteran and widowed beekeeper in  Ulee's Gold.  Fonda was born in New York in 1940 to Henry Fonda and Frances Ford Seymour, a Canadian-born US socialite, who killed herself when Peter Fonda was just 10. Fonda produced Easy Rider and Dennis Hopper directed it for a meager $380,000. It went on to gross $40 million worldwide, a substantial sum for its time. He remained prolific for the rest of his life, with notable performances as the heel in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey, from 1999, and in James Mangold's 2007 update of 3:10 to Yuma. Although Fonda never achieved the status of his father or his older sister, the impact of Easy Rider was enough to cement his place in popular culture. Fonda had an estranged relationship with his father for most of his life, but he said that they grew closer over the years before Henry Fonda died in 1982. Fonda is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, as well as his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda, and his son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer.",Peter Fonda Dead at 79,Peter Fonda Dead at ____,79,Copy( 79 ),0

"(Dec 15, 2014  8:08 AM) A 4-year-old boy went on a couple of roller-coaster rides during a family vacation over the summer and left the amusement park with a torn carotid artery. Doctors report in the journal Pediatric Neurology that the jerkiness and gravitational forces of the ride appear to be the culprit, and that the tear resulted in a blood clot that traveled to the boy's brain, causing a stroke. The boy began vomiting the next day, then developed a droop on the left side of his face on the flight home and soon couldn't walk, reports Eureka Alerts. The doctors say that while several cases of stroke resulting from roller-coaster rides have been documented in adults, this is the youngest known case—in fact, they've identified only two other pediatric cases in medical literature, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a  hypermobility  that makes them more vulnerable to such tears,  albeit rarely.  Six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports CBS News.

"(Mar 28, 2017  6:15 PM CDT) It turns out the robot uprising was a whole lot less The Terminator and a whole lot more Roger & Me. A study from economists at MIT and Boston University published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research attempts to quantify the effects of industrial automation on American employment. It found that between 1990 and 2007, each robot added to the workforce reduced employment in the local commuting area by three to six jobs, Quartz reports. The addition of one robot per thousand workers also lowered wages by 0.25% to 0.5%. Overall, the report estimates robots cost the US between 360,000 and 670,000 jobs total during the span in question, according to the Verge. But robots don't affect all jobs equally. Unsurprisingly, robots had the biggest impact on the wages of America's lowest earners—blue collar workers and those without a college education—and could be responsible for growing the wage gap, Bloomberg reports. The automotive industry has taken the brunt of the robot uprising, with 39% of the US' industrial robots working in that industry. Some experts expect the number of robots working in the US to more than double by 2025 to more than 3 million. And it remains to be seen whether the market will find new jobs for humans, as it has after the advent of new technologies in the past, or whether robots will continue to depress employment and wages into the future.

"(Feb 27, 2020  5:16 AM) A Texas teacher who was forced out of the job she loved for showing students a photo of the woman she was going to marry has settled with the school district for $100,000. Stacy Bailey was suspended from her position as an art teacher at Arlington's Charlotte Anderson Elementary School in 2017 after introducing herself to fourth-grade students with photos of family members and her fiancee, causing a parent to complain that she was promoting  the homosexual agenda.  The district agreed to a settlement after a judge ruled the suspension violated her 14th Amendment right to equal protection, NBC reports. Bailey—who married Julie Vasquez two years ago—was transferred to a high school four months after she filed a lawsuit in April 2018. Before the suspension, Bailey had worked at the school for 10 years and was named Teacher of the Year twice. As part of the settlement, the Mansfield Independent School District has agreed to wipe the suspension from the record and train staff members on LGBTQ issues.  If a district is thinking about bullying or shaming a gay teacher out of their job, I hope they remember my name,  Bailey tells the New York Times.  And I hope they think twice.  She is donating $10,000 from the settlement to a group that supports gay students. Texas does not have a law banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, but  the judge's ruling is clear: that gay teachers are protected by the constitution,  her lawyer says.",Teacher Who Showed Photo of Future Wife Gets $100K Settlement,Teacher Who Showed Photo of Future Wife Gets $____K Settlement,100,"Paraphrase( 100,000 , K )",1

The new study—in which 200 experts examined 1,500 species of snakes, turtles, lizards, crocodiles, and other reptiles—claims to be the most comprehensive made of the world's reptile populations. Of those reptiles at risk, more than 10% are critically endangered, 41% are endangered, and the rest are considered vulnerable. Freshwater reptiles are particularly at risk, with one-third estimated to be close to extinction, especially freshwater turtles.  The findings sound alarm bells about the state of these species and the growing threats that they face,  said one conservationist. One of the study's authors noted that many people wrongly assume reptiles to be resilient animals; in truth,  many species are very highly specialized in terms of habitat use and the climate conditions they require for day-to-day functioning.

"(Nov 25, 2014  4:00 PM) Florida police say they have uncovered an online prostitution ring that was allegedly run by a 17-year-old girl. Alexa Nicole De Armas was arrested on Friday after police caught wind of the ring; four female students at Sarasota County's Venice High reportedly told their teachers that Alexa and a male student had pushed them to join the ring. Per police documents, Alexa and a second student came up with what the Herald-Tribune terms a  business plan  before the school year began. Their alleged intention was to pimp out fellow teens in exchange for money and alcohol. Deals were arranged via Facebook messages, and WWSB reports the girls said Alexa used Facebook to facilitate things because she doesn't have a cell phone. Students say three deals were made, and police say at least one sex act did take place: John Michael Mosher, 21, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old against her will after forking over $40 and a bottle of liquor; he has been arrested. Police got a search warrant for Alexa's Facebook account, and say they found communications regarding participants, how to split the money, and pricing, which apparently topped out at $100. The Herald-Tribune prints one such exchange to a  business partner,  which reads:  Why pimp out old hoes when I have fresh young hoes I can give up for money?

At 6-foot-7, Arness dominated TV screens as Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke, which ran from 1955 to 1975 and defined the TV Western. Arness had been wary about taking a TV role because he was afraid of losing his chance to be in movies. It was John Wayne who pushed Arness to become Marshal Dillon and who introduced him to the show's viewers: I knew there was only one man to play in it,  said Wayne.  I've worked with him, and I predict he'll be a big star.  Arness was born in Minneapolis in 1923, three years prior to his brother actor, the late Peter Graves.

"(Sep 16, 2015  7:00 PM CDT) Officials expect General Motors will be fined hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement over faulty ignition switches that resulted in 124 deaths and 273 injuries, NBC News reports. A settlement between GM and the Justice Department could come as early as tomorrow, though the Wall Street Journal—citing  people familiar with the matter —warns any deal could still fall apart. Last year, the government accused GM of taking too long to disclose the ignition switch problem in violation of federal law, NBC reports. The government alleges GM knew about defect—which could shut off the car's engine without warning, disabling airbags and power steering and brakes—for more than a decade before finally reporting it. The Journal reports the settlement will likely come with a charge of criminal wire fraud against GM for making misleading statements and hiding information about the problem. For example, a government report found GM avoided using the word  stall  when discussing the issue to avoid people thinking it was a safety problem. According to sources cited by the Journal and NBC, GM will be fined somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion. The amount is expected to be less than the $1.2 billion Toyota was fined in a similar case last year because GM cooperated with the government investigation, the Journal reports.

The men, who were granted $7.5 million each, were among hundreds of mentally disabled Henry's Turkey Service workers sent from Texas to a labor camp in Iowa, the Des Moines Register reports. They earned 41 cents an hour working in a meat-processing plant and lived in a 100-year-old former school building where they  were treated like cattle—like company property,  says a witness for the prosecution. The decades-long operation ended after the Register began investigating living conditions in 2009.

If the eyes of Iowa saw what was happening ... the party was going to be over,  a lawyer said. The bunkhouse supervisor was accused of handcuffing one man to a bed; reports also suggested men were beaten after breaking rules.

If you're not sure what kind of cloud you're seeing above your head, consult the World Meteorological Organization's International Cloud Atlas, newly updated just in time for World Meteorological Day on Thursday. The Weather Channel reports that a bunch of new classifications have been added to the atlas (the first fully web-based version) for the first time in three decades, including the volutus  roll cloud  and aforementioned asperitas, as well as human-created cloud types like contrails (the condensation trails left in the wake of airplanes). There's even a new  accessory  cloud known as the flumen (aka  beaver's tail ), which sometimes follows along with a convective storm, a WMO press release notes. The science behind the atlas's cloud classifications, which Live Science calls  not for the faint of heart,  is a sophisticated one. The 10 cornerstone clouds, referred to as  genera,  are the ones you've likely heard of—stratus and cumulus, among others. Then the classification gets more granular with  species,  which break down the genera clouds further based on shapes, and from there to  varieties,  which indicate transparency and arrangement. The recent additions fall under the species category; there's also a new  supplementary features  section of  unusual parts —such as the aforementioned asperitas, a wavy look to a cloud's underside—and five  special  clouds, including the contrail and clouds formed by waterfall mist.

Bronson, 57, was riding his motorcycle in Kansas City just after midnight on April 7, 2013, when O'Kelly, who ultimately pleaded guilty, hit him with his Ford F-150 after failing to stop at a red light. O'Kelly then fled the scene.  It’s unthinkable,  says Bronson's stepson of the sentence.  It teaches other drunk drivers that if they get in a wreck—fatality or nonfatality—to just run and you will get a light sentence.  The judge and prosecutors say they were limited in their sentencing ability by the evidence they had available—as WFSB points out, investigators could not prove O'Kelly's blood alcohol content at the time of the crash. Cell phone records showed that O'Kelly was on his phone at the time of the accident, and witnesses said he had been drinking at a tavern earlier in the night and appeared intoxicated. But one potential witness—his girlfriend, who allegedly told her father that O'Kelly was drunk at the time—never testified, as O'Kelly married her, and Missouri law does not require spouses to testify in such cases. O'Kelly, who had a prior DUI conviction and who told the family he was  super sorry about what happened,  was sentenced to seven years on a charge of involuntary vehicular manslaughter due to intoxication and four years on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, to be served concurrently. But as part of the plea deal, both sentences were suspended as O'Kelly serves a 120-day callback sentence—and if that goes without incident, he'll get probation instead of further jail time. The driver who killed Bronson's wife and daughter was in 2012 sentenced to 15 years.",Drunk Driver Who Killed Man to Serve 120 Days in Jail,Drunk Driver Who Killed Man to Serve ____ Days in Jail,120,Copy( 120 ),0
"(May 21, 2019  3:04 AM CDT) Two young American siblings survived a night alone in a forested area on a Canadian mountain after following their father's instructions and staying put. Search and rescue officials say the 6-year-old girl, the 7-year-old boy, and their father fell down a  steep, treacherous cliff  into a creek drainage area after getting lost on Mount Burke in British Columbia on Sunday while trying to get to a lake to go fishing, the CBC reports. Authorities say the injured father wrapped the children up in warm clothes and told them to stay where they were while he climbed back up the hill to seek help. Authorities say the family was visiting from Georgia and the father was unfamiliar with the area. Crews searched for the children all night after getting the father's call for help around 7pm. The kids were found around 8:30am Monday and brought out in a helicopter longline rescue.  This was really a miraculous rescue and a really positive outcome,  says Coquitlam Search and Rescue manager Ian MacDonald.  This is very rugged terrain where they were lost so we were just very, very thankful that they were found alive and uninjured.  He says a backpack and some shoes were like a  trail of breadcrumbs  that led searchers to the siblings, CTV reports. Brad Rennie from Ridge Meadows Search and Rescue says the kids were spotted hiding under a gray sweatshirt where they were  invisible, pretty much like a rock.   The kids did a great job.

"(Nov 17, 2020  5:11 PM) Rudy Giuliani's courtroom skills may be a little rusty—an election case in Pennsylvania Tuesday was his first appearance in a federal court since 1992, according to court records—but sources say he's still seeking an extremely high price for his services. Insiders tell the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal that the former New York City mayor, who is overseeing President Trump's election challenges, has asked the Trump campaign for $20,000 a day, which would make him one of the highest-paid lawyers on the planet. Giuliani, who started representing Trump for free during the Mueller investigation in 2018, started asking for a fee the day after Election Day, the sources say. Giuliani denied the reports, telling the Times that he  never asked for $20,000  and  the arrangement is, we'll work it out at the end.  Giuliani was granted permission to participate just before the Tuesday hearing on Pennsylvania's motion to dismiss a Trump campaign lawsuit to block certification of election results began, Bloomberg reports. Giuliani alleged that Democrats had allowed widespread fraud to take place by blocking monitoring of mail-in ballots.  If this is allowed without serious sanctions, this will become an epidemic,  he told Judge Matthew Brann. Mark Aronchick, a lawyer for several county election boards, called Giuliani's attempt to have 700,000 mail-in ballots invalidated  disgraceful  and accused him of living in a  fantasy world.  During the Brann hearing, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed another defeat to the Trump campaign with a 5-2 opinion that officials had given GOP observers sufficient access to vote-counting in Philadelphia, the AP reports.",Report: Giuliani Asked to Be Paid $20K a Day,Report: Giuliani Asked to Be Paid $____K a Day,20,"Paraphrase( 20,000 , K )",1

According to a lengthy email exchange published by the Boston Globe, Ben Edelman is seriously agitated, and though the mom-and-pop shop only overcharged him $4, he says it's the principle.  If you look at my other work ... you'll see I've been pretty diligent in holding large companies accountable for their false statements of price and other attempts to overcharge passengers,  he tells Business Insider.  Should all small businesses get a free pass?  The restaurant, Sichuan Garden, appears to have thus far complied with Edelman's requests, including refunding him $12 (three times what he was overcharged) and updating the online menu to reflect actual prices. Ran Duan, who tends bar at the restaurant for his parents, recently told the Globe:  I personally respond to every complaint and try to handle every situation personally. ... I have worked so hard to make my family proud and to elevate our business. [This exchange] just broke my heart.

Police initially said two officers were wounded Sunday as they tried to serve a search warrant following a kidnapping attempt in Chickasha, about 40 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, the AP reports. Chickasha Police Chief Goebel Music said Tuesday that seven officers were injured after the suspect allegedly opened fire from a home. Music says two officers were taken to a hospital. One was treated for shrapnel wounds and released. The other was repeatedly shot in the arm and remains hospitalized. Music says the five other officers were treated at the scene for lesser injuries. The suspect, 61-year-old Alex Warren Klingler, is jailed on complaints including shooting with intent to kill. Music says police went to Klingler's home after he allegedly tried to pull a woman into his car, using so much force that both her wrists were broken, the Chickasha Express-Star reports. Five officers fired their weapons during the hour-long standoff.

"(Jul 11, 2019  10:05 AM CDT) Technology and communications companies pushed stocks higher on Wall Street in early trading Thursday, extending the market's gains from the day before. The early buying briefly nudged the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 27,000-point mark for the first time, a day after the S&P 500 made its first move above 3,000, the AP reports. The Dow has since come down a bit; as of this writing, it was at 26,985. The market shook off a two-day slide earlier this week and has been trending higher as investors have grown more confident that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates for the first time in a decade as soon as the end of July. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said many Fed officials believe a weakening global economy and rising trade tensions have strengthened the case for a rate cut. The remarks came as Powell gave testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He was due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday. The market rallied through much of June after the central bank first signaled that it was prepared to cut rates to offset slowing global growth and the fallout from US trade conflicts.

Security forces raided the Bataclan concert hall, killing at least two attackers wielding assault weapons, police said. One official described  carnage  inside the hall, saying the attackers had tossed explosives at the hostages. It was one of at least six attacks Friday night in the French capital. One of the targets was the nation's main sports stadium, where President Francois Hollande was attending a soccer game. He was evacuated safely when at least two bombs, apparently the work of suicide attackers, went off near the stadium. As of now, the total death is about 140, reports Reuters, but that is expected to rise. At the White House, President Obama expressed solidarity with France, reports the New York Times.

Wallace Bock and Irving H. Kamsler will each receive $500,000, plus additional monies for their roles as executors of the estate and members of the new foundation's board. The Manhattan DA's office is investigating the duo's handling of Clark's money, a source tells the New York Times. Relatives have questioned Bock's and Kamsler's intentions in the past, and accused them of blocking visits from Clark's relatives. Bock's own drafting of the 2005 will is also raising eyebrows. The will explicitly declares that no family members receive anything after her death. Clark's nurse is the biggest individual beneficiary, receiving a doll collection that could be worth millions as well as 60% of various assets worth some $40 million. Most of Clark's assets, including an oceanfront Santa Barbara estate and most of her art collection, which includes works by Monet and Renoir, will go into a foundation that will be created to promote the arts.

Laura Miera had just dropped off her 14-year-old daughter at Jimmy Carter Middle School and was waiting at a traffic light when the semi exited a freeway and came barreling toward her.

Today it's CBS making that call with CBS All Access, an on-demand service that offers streaming of current and past seasons of popular CBS shows, as well as classic shows, for $5.99 a month, TVLine.com reports. According to a CBS press release, the service offers new episodes of 15 current prime-time shows the day after they air; live-streaming of local CBS stations in 14 markets (with more to be added); full past seasons of favorites like Survivor and The Good Wife;  CBS Classics  like Twin Peaks and Cheers; and the ability to live-stream Big Brother around the clock.

Electricity failed as the fire spread, and towering, sparking flames turned the night sky orange over the darkened remains of entire neighborhoods. Bachelet declared the entire city a catastrophe zone, putting Chile's military in charge of maintaining order. While 1,250 firefighters, police and forest rangers battled the blaze, 2,000 Chilean sailors in combat gear patrolled streets to maintain order and prevent looting. Shelters were overflowing, and hospitals treated hundreds of people for breathing problems provoked by the smoke. Valparaiso, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003, is known for colorful neighborhoods hugging hills so steep that people have to use staircases rather than streets. About 75 miles northwest of the capital, Santiago, it has a vibrant port and is home to Chile's national legislature. But many homes in poorer areas above the city center have been built without water supplies or access points that would enable firefighters to intervene, so much of today's fight is happening from the air.",16 Dead as Chile's Historic Valparaiso Burns,____ Dead as Chile's Historic Valparaiso Burns,16,Copy( 16 ),0

That entry and others describing the journal writer breaking into a house to steal food or keeping tabs on the ensuing manhunt were read to a Pennsylvania jury during Frein's murder trial on Wednesday, reports the NBC News. The 33-year-old is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson II and critically injuring Trooper Alex Douglass outside the Blooming Grove barracks in Pike County on Sept. 12, 2014. The shooting spawned a 48-day manhunt before Frein was captured near an abandoned airplane hangar on Oct. 30.  This massive search cannot last forever,  an Oct. 4 entry reads. Days later, Frein allegedly wrote,  30 Days. A lot longer than I expected to last.  The journal also details a revolution, asks Jesus Christ for mercy, describes people being just 100 yards away at one point, and scoffs at Frein's description in the media as a survivalist, reports the Allentown Morning Call.  HA! Catchy phrase, I guess,  the journal reads. The entries were read a day after jurors saw a video in which Frein allegedly told police,  I did this. No one else did.  Defense lawyers are appealing a ruling allowing the video to be used at trial, arguing it violated Frein's Miranda rights, per PennLive. Frein has pleaded not guilty to murder, terrorism, and other charges; he could face the death penalty. (The manhunt for Frein cost $11 million.)",Pa.

The decision came about quite organically, like most things in REM,  he says. By the end of that tour—which became their last— we all kind of knew that these were most likely going to be our last shows. It was already, for us, bittersweet and weird and hard.  He says the thought of not performing live again is  actually painful to think about,  but the band didn’t want to leave things open-ended because the members needed  closure  in order to move forward with new projects. Why not do a farewell tour?  The idea of doing some kind of victory lap … just felt—and still feels—like it would have been completely mercenary and exploitative and impossible,  Stipe says. Not to mention emotional for the band:  I could not perform ‘Everybody Hurts’ for the last time in London with 30,000 people in the room or 80,000 people on the field knowing full well it was the last time we were going to do it.

"(Oct 21, 2016  10:06 AM CDT) There have long been complaints about the lack of women in the tech industry. Now there's a towering female figure, in a tech park across the bay from San Francisco, although not quite what some people had in mind. A 55-foot-tall statue of a nude woman unveiled this week in the community of San Leandro is stirring controversy and a lot of conversation, the AP reports. At the base of the 13,000-pound statue is a message in 10 languages that says:  What would the world be like if women were safe?  The statue—roughly three times as tall as Michelangelo's David—is made of steel mesh in the form of a graceful dancer, with an arched back and arms stretched overhead. The debate, however, is not over its artistic merit—it's over whether it's appropriate in public. The Truth Is Beauty statue by sculptor Marco Cochrane is on private property at the edge of a new tech office complex, in a highly trafficked area just across from San Leandro's commuter rail station. Cochrane says he was marked as a child by the rape of a neighborhood friend and tries through art to bring attention to sexual assault, and to both the fear and strength many women feel. Not everyone shares his views on the statue, now attracting selfie-seekers.  If she's a ballerina, she should have some clothes on,  says a local mom. But others have welcomed the statue as a reflection of the changing demographics in San Leandro, where millennials now outnumber older residents.

The Times Company had earlier considered a $275 million bid by Answers.com, but will instead sell the About network to IAC for some $300 million in cash, the Times reported last night. The site, once a moneymaker for the Times Company (which purchased it for $400 million in 2005), took a big hit after a Google algorithm change last year; revenue was down 8.7% in the last quarter to $25.4 million.

"(Jun 13, 2014  6:45 AM CDT) The cool kids don't exactly win in the end: Teens who try to be cool by acting older than they are may be setting themselves up for future problems, according to a new study in the journal Child Development. Researchers followed 184 Southeastern teens from ethnically diverse backgrounds in public schools for 10 years starting when the teens were 13. The kids deemed popular by their peers tended to be in romantic relationships, engage in delinquent activities, and hang with the prettiest peers, but by 22 those kids were no longer at the top of the totem pole—and were also more likely to be involved in criminal activities and have serious problems with drugs and alcohol, reports Eureka Alert. They were also judged as being less competent in managing social relationships.  We call it the high school reunion effect—the student who was popular and was running with the fast crowd isn't doing as great later on,  the study's lead author tells NPR. The reason, he surmises, may be that as the cool kids aged, they felt they had to do increasingly extreme things to get noticed, while their peers, who were continuing to mature, were less impressed by those behaviors. The researchers stressed that this doesn't mean being cool at 13 is a  life sentence,  but that teens who focus heavily on physical appearance and social hierarchies may be putting all their eggs in the short-term popularity basket instead of the longer-term happiness basket.

"(Dec 6, 2016  6:10 PM) Humans have built a ton of things to keep us alive on this twirling little rock: farms, airports, roads, CDs, houses, computers, landfills, and so forth. All these things are known as the technosphere, and for the first time ever—in a study published last month in the Anthropocene Review—scientists have estimated their total weight: an impressive 30 trillion tons. According to Forbes, that's  enough to add another good-sized mountain to the Appalachians, or perhaps even to the Rockies.  Or as a press release breaks it down, it's roughly 110 pounds per square meter of the Earth's surface. Researchers say the technosphere is a  major new phenomenon on this planet  that is  evolving extraordinarily rapidly.  It's also a handy means of measuring how much humans have shaped the planet. Scientists argue that the sheer scale of the technosphere is convincing evidence that we're living in a new, as-yet-unofficial geologic epoch known as the  Anthropocene,  Gizmodo reports. The quickest way to be recognized as an epoch is to have a discernible fossil record, and due to the fact that the technosphere is—unlike the biosphere— remarkably poor at recycling its own materials,  that shouldn't be a problem. If  technofossils  from the Anthropocene were classified like normal fossils, there would more than a billion different types, outnumbering the types of species currently alive.

Ferhat Tokay said he used the shoes as a pillow when he slept, and tried to dig himself free with the aid of a rock. Despite being trapped for 108 hours, Tokay was apparently unharmed, according to his uncle.  We started digging and at first we saw his hand. And then we started speaking to him. He said 'I am hungry and thirsty,'  a medic told Reuters of finding Tokay.  My feelings are inexplicable. It was like taking my own son out.  Turkey's official death toll has now climbed to 570, with 2,555 injured, and more than 50,000 left homeless, reports the AP.","5 Days After Quake, Teen Found Alive","____ Days After Quake, Teen Found Alive",5,Copy( 5 ),0

Lawyer Lisa Bloom says she plans to file a lawsuit in California Monday on behalf of  Jane Doe,   John Doe,  and a third accuser who will speak at a New York news conference Bloom will hold Monday, reports TMZ. People notes that  knowingly or recklessly  passing on an STD is a violation of California law. Usher reportedly settled a suit in 2012 brought by a celebrity stylist who claimed the singer gave her herpes, per a RadarOnline article published in July that put the settlement at $1.1 million. The suit says Usher  consciously and purposefully  kept silent about his alleged STD while he  continued to have unprotected sex  with the woman.

"(Mar 12, 2011  4:12 PM) Ouch. Blue Shield of California is requesting another rate hike to go into effect in May. Coming on the heels of two others in October and January, it would bring the cumulative increase in premiums to 50% for more for 45,500 customers and 80% or more for about 900, reports the Los Angeles Times. For a handful of especially lucky people, the increase is 86.5%. When Blue Shield sent out notices this year about the third potential hike, it calculated the highest cumulative increase at 59%—because it didn't factor in the October hike from 2010.

Police and witnesses say Charles Murphy, 56, jumped from a balcony at Sofitel New York Hotel in his business suit shortly before 5pm and died at the scene. Murphy's hedge fund at Fairfield Greenwich lost $50 million of the $7.5 billion it invested with Madoff, per DNA Info, and was subsequently sued by investors. Murphy had since been working at investment management firm Paulson & Co. It's unclear whether he personally lost money in Madoff's scam. Murphy, who is survived by his wife and four children, was  a brilliant man, a great partner and a true friend,  said founder John Paulson in a statement. A French aristocrat who'd lost $1.5 billion in Madoff's scheme previously committed suicide in 2008. Another investor, a 65-year-old former Army major, committed suicide a year later.

William Earl Talbott II was arrested last year and charged with aggravated murder, after authorities said they used genetic genealogy to identify him as the person who left his DNA on the clothing of one of the victims. The practice involves identifying suspects by entering crime-scene DNA profiles into public databases that people have used for years to fill out their family trees.

Another $2.5 billion would help seed renovation projects, hoping to spur $10 billion worth of spending. The last $500 million would be used to create free online courses. Though the $12 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the $100 billion in education funding in the stimulus bill, it’s a big upgrade from the $2 billion in direct aid the government now gives to community colleges.

Jimenez stepped away from Bryan and her own daughter so that she could make lunch as the little ones played and watched TV. The toddlers had been playfully ripping up paper towels, and somehow, Bryan choked on some of them. Jimenez frantically tried to clear his airway and couldn't; ultimately, one of the responding paramedics had to use forceps to remove an egg-sized mass of bloody paper towels from his throat. The boy did not survive. Jimenez, who said she loved Bryan as if he were her own son, was found guilty of his murder. But in an extensive look at the case for Texas Monthly, Michael Hall explains that there are quite a few—including five judges—who believe she was wrongly convicted. While prosecutors argued there was no way a child so young could have stuffed five paper towels down his own throat, a civil lawyer ultimately found a renowned surgeon who said it was  absolutely possible  the incident had been an accidental choking. Three other pediatric specialists agreed. The civil lawyer argued Jimenez's lawyer failed her in various ways, including by using an ineffective expert witness, and an appellate judge ordered a new trial. But in a series of twists and turns, judges, state representatives, the president of Mexico, and others continued to back Jimenez—even the judge from her original trial—yet the woman described as  peaceful  and  loving  on the stand remains behind bars, suffering from a chronic kidney condition that could kill her.

Italian authorities plan to refashion the former World War II radio station Morandi occupies into an environmental observatory, meaning the 81-year-old caretaker must clear out. But Morandi is digging in his feet. He says Budelli has been his only home since he arrived by chance while trying to sail to Polynesia in 1989, as the Atlantic reported in 2016. The former teacher fell in love with the one-mile-long parcel of pink sand and took over for the previous caretaker.  I'm ready to do all I can to stay here,  he tells CNN.  I wouldn't know where else to go.  The island has changed ownership numerous times in recent years. Since 2015, it's been owned by the La Maddalena National Park, whose president considers Morandi to be an  illegal occupant  and points out the structure he lives in has been modified in ways that aren't exactly legal either.  Nobody wants to chase him away, but what title does he have to stay since the island is no longer private?  Fabrizio Fonnesu tells CNN. The eviction battle has been ongoing for years, but construction work is now just months away, and Morandi needs to go when it starts, says Fonnesu.

Fonnesu is making no such promises but says that if a caretaker position opens post-renovation, Morandi could be considered for it—though he points out it would be a highly desirable job.","After 30 Years Alone on an Island, He's Told to Clear Out","After ____ Years Alone on an Island, He's Told to Clear Out",30,Copy( 30 ),0

At the height of his popularity a decade ago, Kinkade's prints and originals brought in $32 million a quarter from 4,500 dealers around the country.

An estimated 1,152 women are raped every day, or 48 per hour, according to a study to appear in the American Journal of Public Health. That's 26 times higher than a previous UN estimate.  The numbers are astounding,  says a Johns Hopkins expert. In one particularly war-ravaged part of the country, 67 out of every 1,000 women have been raped at least once. By comparison, the annual rate in the US is 0.5 per 1,000.

Rest in Peace Chris. We love you,  he wrote on Facebook. It's unclear how Bundy died, though PWInsider reports he'd been lately dealing with health issues. A monster of a wrestler at 6'4  and 458 pounds, Bundy got his start with the WWE in the 1980s. The organization notes he  was so dominant that he demanded referees count to five when he pinned his opponents to show that there was no way they were getting up.  Bundy took just nine seconds to take out Special Delivery Jones in the first WrestleMania in 1985. Though he lost the WWE Championship to Hulk Hogan in the second, his  mammoth girth and devastating splashes came close to putting The Hulkster away for good,  the WWE noted, per NBC News. Bundy also did battle with other legends, including Andre the Giant and Bam Bam Bigelow, before leaving the WWE in the late 1980s.

If the Orbital ATK capsule arrives at the space station Wednesday as planned, it will represent the first US delivery since spring.  Santa is on his way!  tweeted Tory Bruno, president of rocket maker United Launch Alliance. To NASA's relief, the weather cooperated after three days of high wind and cloudy skies that kept the Atlas V rocket firmly on the ground. Everything came together on the fourth launch attempt, allowing the unmanned Atlas to blast off with 7,400 pounds of space station cargo, not to mention some Christmas presents for the awaiting crew. The space station astronauts—two of them, including commander Scott Kelly, deep into a one-year mission—have gone without US shipments since April. Two private companies contracted for more than $3.5 billion by NASA to replenish the 250-mile-high lab are stuck on Earth with grounded rockets. Orbital ATK bought the United Launch Alliance's rocket, the veteran Atlas V, for this supply mission. Orbital's previous grocery run, its fourth, ended in a fiery explosion seconds after liftoff in October 2014. SpaceX, the other supplier, suffered a launch failure in June on its eighth trip. Russia also lost a supply ship earlier this year. But it picked up the slack and has another resupply mission scheduled just before Christmas; Japan has chipped in as well.

"(Nov 5, 2020  4:24 PM) When the pandemic hit, ESPN was left with hardly any games to show for four months. Sports is back, but ratings and advertising still lag. Now the other shoe has dropped for employees of the cable network. The company is laying off 300 people and not filling another 200 jobs, USA Today reports. ESPN made similar cuts in 2015 and 2017. Contracts for certain on-air employees will be allowed to expire. The network has extended the contracts of some on-air staffers with base salaries below $50,000 and bonuses for each on-air appearance, per the New York Times. Many of them had had much larger contracts that guaranteed a certain number of on-air appearances. ESPN employs about 4,000 people at its Connecticut headquarters and another 2,500 around the world. The cuts will hit broadcast production hardest but reach into most parts of the company. In addition to the pandemic, the network is dealing with unfavorable trends, per the New York Times: As viewers switch to streaming services, the number of US households paying for TV programming has fallen from 100.5 million in 2014 to about 80 million now.  Placing resources in support of our direct-to-consumer business strategy, digital, and, of course, continued innovative television experiences, is more critical than ever,  the network's president wrote in the layoff memo. Disney, the network's owner, also has been hit hard by the pandemic, across most of its divisions. Still, ESPN spends huge amounts on league contracts for programming.

Indeed, this kind of willing handover of power is extremely unusual in Gulf Arab dynasties, the AP notes. There are unconfirmed murmurs that it's related to Sheikh Hamad's health, but he's likely to continue to play a role in government. Though the country's prime minister is also likely to depart, politics in Qatar—whose influence is growing—aren't likely to change much. Sheikh Tamim  has been involved very closely with Qatari policy, both domestic and foreign ... for some considerable time,  says an al Jazeera editor.

"(Nov 18, 2017  10:17 AM) The (potentially) former prime minister of Lebanon's mysterious two-week stay in Saudi Arabia has come to an end, as Saad Hariri arrived in France on Saturday morning and met with French President Emmanuel Macron, the New York Times reports. Hariri was in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4 when he suddenly and shockingly resigned as prime minister. Since then, Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept his resignation among widespread speculation Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will, according to the AP. Early Saturday, Hariri tweeted that it was a  lie  that Saudi Arabia was detaining him. However, speculation of Saudi leverage continues as Hariri was joined by his wife and eldest son in France while his younger children—attending school in Saudi Arabia—were notably absent. Aoun says Hariri will return to Lebanon in time for its Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, and it's unclear if Hariri will go ahead with his resignation or take it back upon his return. Hariri told reporters in France that he will  declare my political stance  after meeting with Aoun. He has not publicly discussed what happened during his time in Saudi Arabia. Hariri's resignation and lengthy absence started a political crisis in Lebanon that goes beyond the organization of the government. There is speculation that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign as part of a power struggle with Iran, which Hariri denounced during his resignation, the BBC reports. There is fear of a looming war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which only increased Saturday when Saudi Arabia asked its citizens to leave Lebanon for the second time in two weeks.","After 2 Mysterious Weeks, Lebanese PM Now in France","After ____ Mysterious Weeks, Lebanese PM Now in France",2,Trans( two ),1

Win Zaw Htun and Zaw Lin, who are both 22 years old, were found guilty on Thursday of murdering British tourists David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, the Telegraph reports. They were also found guilty of robbing the pair, whose bodies were discovered on a beach on the island of Koh Tao, and of raping Witheridge.

Street battles raged for hours in Cairo, as demonstrators fired birdshot and threw firebombs at police who responded with gunshots and tear gas. The clashes took place on the 40th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Mideast war—a holiday the military-backed government had wanted to use to pay tribute to the armed forces, whose chief ousted Morsi in a coup in July. In some cases today, pro-military crowds set upon Morsi supporters, with the two sides pelting each other with rocks. By late evening, several parts of the city resembled combat zones, with fires burning, black smoke rising and the crack of gunfire piercing the air, thick with tear gas. Authorities say 32 died in the capital. An AP photographer reports seeing nine bodies lying on the floor in the Cairo district of Dokki, the scene of some of the heaviest clashes.

A European Union announcement on Friday notes that, starting in 2021, Americans will need to also have a visa if they want to travel to the Schengen Area, 26 EU countries that allow people to move freely between nations, per CNN. To receive a European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) visa, US citizens will require a current passport, an email address, and a credit or debit card. The reasoning behind the new requirement:  Similar to other countries and regions in the world, Europe has recently decided to improve their security level to avoid any further problems with illegal migration and terrorism,  per the ETIAS site. A full list of the countries that will soon require the visa, including France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, can be found here.

Tyma and her husband initially owned the house, but after his death, a family friend bought it and rented it to Tyma. Unbeknownst to Tyma, that person had since stopped paying the mortgage; the bank foreclosed on her and booted Tyma from the home when an investment company bought it at auction—padlocking the door and leaving Tyma's belongings in the streets. That was Nov. 16, and her neighbors went into action, making sure her belongings were stored and her two dogs had a place to stay, the Tampa Bay Times reports. But one neighbor went even further.

In a distressing turn, the slump has spread from the financial and manufacturing sectors into a  wide range  of general services. Even health care, traditionally seen as recession-proof, has been feeling the downturn: The Fed noted that certain providers were seeing fewer patients because of a decline in elective procedures.

These families thought they might never see each other again. Tonight's court ruling will change lives,  the ACLU tweeted on a federal judge's preliminary injunction to order all children affected by a  zero tolerance  immigration policy back with their parents. Per the Los Angeles Times, kids younger than 5 must be reunited with parents within 14 days; older children must be reunited within 30 days. In a ruling brought about by a  chaotic circumstance of the government's own making,  US District Judge Dana Sabraw noted  the unfortunate reality  of cars, money, and other personal items being tracked better than the more than 2,000 children who've so far been taken from their parents, per Politico.  Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process.  Under Sabraw's mandate, parents also can't be detained or deported without their kids, unless it's shown a parent is unfit or otherwise poses a danger, and prompt phone contact between parents and kids must be allowed, per NBC News. The injunction was a response to a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two women separated from their children, including a Congolese woman who made headlines. Sabraw's ruling comes on the heels of an executive order from President Trump that was supposed to remedy the separations, but which stayed  silent on the issue of reuniting families that have already been separated or will be separated in the future,  wrote Sabraw, a George W. Bush appointee.

But the company is under scrutiny for more reasons than one, including this big one: A driver hit a 6-year-old girl on New Year's Eve, killing her, and a lawsuit was filed yesterday. It names the driver as well as the company, and says the app-based service is breaking California laws against distracted driving. According to the filing, driver Syed Muzzafar, 57, was using the UberX app to find his next customer when he hit Sofia Liu; the girl's mother and brother were also hurt. Uber drivers  must respond quickly to a user request for service by physically interfacing with the app, thereby leading to distraction,  the suit says. State law requires hands-free devices, but an Uber driver can't grab a fare without pressing the screen at least once. The family's lawyer also says that Uber failed to provide insurance to cover the scenario: Muzzafar had no fare in his car when he hit Sofia; state rules call for insurance to cover drivers while on trips for Uber, says an expert, but it's less clear about insurance for drivers between passengers, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Uber says that since Muzzafar didn't have a passenger, Uber has no culpability in the matter; his lawyer maintains the opposite.  He was waiting for a fare. He was working for Uber.

"(Oct 20, 2012  5:46 PM CDT) Tehran and Washington have agreed to the first-ever direct talks about Iran's nuclear program, but only after Nov. 6—because Iran insists on meeting with a newly elected president, the New York Times reports. The plan could easily fall through, however—either because Iran is bluffing to ease international pressure, or Mitt Romney, if elected, takes a hard line and refuses to meet. Plus Iran is trying to link the talks to other issues, like Syria and Bahrain, which could draw howls from Washington. The proposed negotiations are also fraught with election-year politics, the Times notes. While President Obama could trumpet the talks as a diplomatic breakthrough, opponents may argue that Iran is using him to buy time. Romney is in a tight spot too, because he has opposed letting Iran enrich any uranium—a likely concession if the talks occur.

What is: Whose idea it was and where the money was going to come from. The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post are out with stories about the potential estate transaction, which never came to fruition, against the backdrop of the NRA's tussle with its former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen. Their 30-year relationship fell apart earlier this year, and in April the NRA announced it was suing. The Post explains the mansion revelation comes as part of the New York attorney general's office's probe of the NRA's tax-exempt status, which surfaced documents related to the considered purchase. The Journal's sources say that after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., LaPierre was concerned about his own security and the fact that his Virginia address was widely known. An NRA rep says then-agency CEO Angus McQueen, who died in July, suggested the agency purchase the house as an investment property for LaPierre to live in. Per the rep,  The deal was vetoed by the NRA after its full terms—including Ackerman’s intent to spend NRA money—became known.  But other sources say the idea was LaPierre's, and that it was McQueen who scuttled the deal after learning its terms; per the source, LaPierre wanted to also become a member of the tony golf club beside the property, which led McQueen to question whether LaPierre's motivation was really security-based.

The accident occurred Wednesday on a portion of a road repair project in the state capital. Police spokeswoman Angela Sands says that police won't ticket the driver, 19-year-old Shadrach Yasiah, the AP reports. But he still faces some financial pain. A police incident report says that it wasn't obvious that the concrete wasn't dry and that Yasiah drove into it through a 24-foot gap between traffic control cones. Still, city engineer Thomas Shafer says the driver (or his insurance company, notes the Lincoln Journal Star) is responsible for the repairs. He says the contractor estimated it will cost more than $10,000 to pay for removing the car, scraping out the ruined slurry, repouring more, and finishing it.",Driver Makes $10K Mistake in Newly Poured Concrete,Driver Makes $____K Mistake in Newly Poured Concrete,10,"Paraphrase( 10,000 , K )",1
"(Apr 6, 2016  5:25 PM CDT) For 29 years, motel owner Gerald Foos watched hundreds, perhaps thousands, of guests having sex, going to the bathroom, and more at the Manor House Motel in Colorado. Now the story of the  greatest voyeur in the world  is out in the open, thanks to an article published in the New Yorker by journalist Gay Talese. The author says he first learned of Foos when the latter wrote him a letter in 1980.  Sexually, I have witnessed, observed, and studied the best first hand, unrehearsed, non-laboratory sex between couples, and most other conceivable sex deviations during these past 15 years,  it read. Foos—who sold the motel in 1995—wanted to be seen as a  sex researcher and social observer,  not a mere Peeping Tom and pervert, according to the Denver Post. To that end, Foos kept detailed notes of everything he witnessed through his fake ceiling vents. For example, in 1973 he catalogued 184 male orgasms and 33 female orgasms, and noted that white heterosexuals tended to have missionary sex and that only 3% of his guests failed to have sex. Talese even joined Foos in his attic  laboratory  on at least one occasion and found the man had an  uncontrollable desire to peer into other people's lives.  The statute of limitations has passed on any voyeur-related crimes, reports the Post, but Talese writes that Foos could face trouble over a 1977 murder he says he witnessed but never reported—assuming it actually happened. Foos tells the Post that Talese's article could  create a real situation.   I don't know if I'm ready for anything, to be honest with you,  he says.  I'm just a poor soul.  Foos maintains that no guests were ever harmed by his voyeurism as they never knew they were being watched.

But you don't often see one arrested for felony vandalism, especially when the brothers are players for two different NFL teams. TMZ has video of the  bizarre naked struggle  Monday night between 22-year-old Buffalo Bills receiver Zay Jones and his older brother, 25-year-old Cayleb Jones, a receiver for the Minnesota Vikings. The skirmish went down in a Los Angeles apartment building, where the party who was naked—Zay Jones—can be heard in the video yelling,  I'm going to fight for Jesus  before briefly scuffling with Cayleb in a hallway, then running out of the frame as a woman in the background screams; TMZ identifies her as Cayleb's girlfriend and says it was her apartment they were near. Witnesses tell TMZ Zay Jones eventually made his way onto a public balcony on the 30th floor and smashed his foot through a window, with Cayleb having to restrain him from leaping out of the hole. In the video, the aftermath can be seen, with the walls and carpet in the vicinity splattered with blood and a woman in the background saying it looks like a  f---ing murder scene.  An LAPD rep confirms to the Buffalo News that a man identified later as  Isaiah Jones  (Zay Jones' official name) had smashed  doors and windows  at the building, and that they brought him into custody close to midnight. Per ESPN, Jones was arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism and had his bail set at $20,000; he has a court date of April 11. In a statement, the Bills noted they'd been informed of the situation and are  still in the process of gathering more information.

Lots, as in 2.3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2010, reports the San Jose Mercury News. That's enough for about 200,000 houses. The company released its energy figures for the first time today, and one exec tells the New York Times that while the number sounds enormous, critics should consider that Google helps the world save energy, too. People can search by computer, for example, rather than driving to the library. Google also notes that each user only consumes about 180 watt-hours a month—which is equivalent to running a 60-watt light bulb for three hours. The company also says it emitted 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, which the Mercury News equates to the emissions of 70,000 Americans. Google says about a quarter of its energy comes from renewable fuels, and it plans to raise that to 30% this year.

Sowers discussed her sexuality for the first time publicly Tuesday on Outsports.  There are so many people who identify as LGBT in the NFL, as in any business, that do not feel comfortable being public about their sexual orientation,  Sowers says.

Analysis of the cat bones found in a millet-farming village suggest that cats were living alongside humans 5,300 years ago, long before the previous earliest-known records of cats living with people in Egypt 4,000 years ago. Researchers believe the cats lived in human settlements and were tolerated because of their ability to catch rats and mice, though the remains of an older cat show that its diet was heavy in grain, raising the  possibility that this cat was unable to hunt and scavenged for discarded human food or that it was looked after and fed by people.

"(Sep 10, 2011  3:49 PM CDT) After 9/11, a  cabal of extremist billionaires  escalated a class war that has crushed the American people and threatened the world, Gerald Caplan writes in the Globe & Mail.  There are more filthy rich folks now than at any other moment in history,  he writes, but wounded war veterans have been neglected, and 9/11 first responders nearly lost their health care when the GOP made a politically scary gamble to save the Bush tax cuts.  Writ small, this is the history of the post-9/11 world.  Drawing on ideas of Naomi Klein, Caplan sees radically free market policies dominating the world since 9/11, from Iraq oil reserves to private mercenary armies to public facilities closed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Then came  the catastrophic economic collapse engineered by the geniuses of Wall Street,  and  the latest elite consensus —austerity programs—which have hurt people even more.  Osama bin Laden inflicted a terrible crime on the American people,  writes Caplan.

Hurricane Katrina, in many ways, was not as impactful as Hurricane Sandy, believe it or not,  the New York governor said.  Because of the density of New York, the number of people affected, the number of properties affected was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than Hurricane Katrina.  Still,  Katrina had a human toll that thankfully we have not paid in this region.  Katrina was to blame for 1,866 deaths; Sandy was responsible for about 100, the New York Post notes. Sandy, however, damaged some 305,000 homes and 265,300 businesses, while Katrina hit 214,700 homes and 18,700 businesses. Cuomo put the storm's damage, plus the cost of preparations for future storms, at $42 billion. The comparison between storms  puts the entire conversation ... in focus,  says Cuomo—but is the comparison valid? It's dicey at best, according to many on Twitter, as well as Connor Simpson at the Atlantic Wire.

She was first arrested last year after Karima Gordon died of a blood clot in her lung a few days after the injection. Now authorities say a similar thing happened in 2010 with a woman named Marilyn Hale. Officials say Gordon found someone named  Pebbles  on the Internet, met up with her and paid her $200, and was referred to Garner for the procedure.

For many months, she suffered numerous acts of unspeakable violence,  one of her lawyers says in a new statement on behalf of the family.  Through her faith, fortitude, and resilience, she is alive today and home with her family.  But the statement reveals little more about the girl's ordeal, which began on Oct. 9, 2013, and ended when she came home, pale and thin, on July 20, reports the Washington Post. The statement also asks the public to give Abby, 15, time to  physically and emotionally heal,  adding,  It is going to be a long process in pursuit of justice for Abby and for Abby to get … stronger. We do not intend to have this case tried in the press.  As the investigation moves forward, the family’s lawyers say more details about Abby's experience will come to light. Prosecutors and the FBI are mum following the statement's release, but some suggestive details have emerged. Prosecutors believe Abby was held at a trailer park in New Hampshire where suspected kidnapper Nathaniel Kibby lived; his mobile home and a storage container located there are now the center of a legal battle, the Boston Globe reports. Prosecutors want to remove them and put them in storage, but Kibby's public defenders want to be allowed to investigate them first. Last week, a judge ruled both would stay put for now.

Jerry Correll, 59, was pronounced dead at 7:36pm at Florida State Prison after receiving a lethal injection. The execution came after the US Supreme Court rejected his latest appeals. Correll is the 22nd inmate to be executed under Gov. Rick Scott—the most executions under a single governor since the death penalty was reinstated in Florida in 1979. Correll, strapped to the death gurney, said  No, sir  when asked if he had any final statement before his execution. He was pronounced dead nine minutes after the lethal injection was administered. In 1986, he was found guilty and sentenced to death for each of four July 1985 slayings in Orlando. A jury convicted him of killing his former wife, Susan; their 5-year-old daughter, Tuesday; Susan Correll's mother, Mary Lou Hines; and Susan Correll's sister, Marybeth Jones.

The statistics were released during the opening address of a hearing of Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the AP reports. The royal commission—which is Australia's highest form of inquiry—has been investigating since 2013 how the Catholic Church and other institutions responded to the sexual abuse of children over decades. Commissioners surveyed church authorities and found that between 1980 and 2015, 4,444 people reported they had been abused at more than 1,000 Catholic institutions across Australia, said Gail Furness, the lead lawyer assisting the commission. The average age of the victims was 10.5 for girls and 11.5 for boys. Francis Sullivan, CEO of the Truth Justice and Healing Council, which is coordinating the Catholic Church's response to the inquiry, said the data reflected  a massive failure  by the church to protect children.

A 12-pack of Smart Water was selling for $29.98 with a warning there was a  Limited Supply.  After a photo of the steep prices at the store in Cypress, Texas, went viral and outraged tweeters pummeled the big-box retailer, a rep issued a mea culpa, calling the pricing  a big mistake  made by an employee. The worker calculated the costs based on the price per individual bottle, which is how Best Buy usually sells its water. The electronics giant was focused  on helping, not hurting  Texans affected by Hurricane Harvey, the rep said.  It won't happen again.  But Best Buy isn't alone. More than 600 complaints of outrageous prices have poured into the Texas Attorney General's office, including stores charging $100 for a case of drinking water, hotels tripling rates, and gas going for $10 a gallon, CBS News reports.

The Democratic candidate has spent $63,000 with the network for five days' worth of ads targeting Sunshine State markets starting Thursday. But while it's a smart pre-election purchase in terms of viewership (the Weather Channel is likely to see a surge of watchers as the storm progresses), it could backfire if voters think Clinton is exploiting a dangerous situation for political benefit. (Politico notes other candidates, including Donald Trump, have also bought Weather Channel ads in 2016. It's usually a tricky political situation with a major weather event, as political leaders toe the line between taking charge in affected areas and not looking like  a politically crass politician who's parachuting in for a photo-op,  as an adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign puts it. There's even a difference between how a president is received versus candidates. President Obama himself was set to be in Florida campaigning for Clinton, but he was stymied by Matthew and called his pitch into a Miami radio station instead, per the Miami Herald. A Clinton campaign rep downplays the Weather Channel ads, noting it was  less than 1%  of the campaign's recent media spending in battleground states.

About half of that big revision reflected the punishing effect the summer's drought has had on farmers, as the government slashed its crop production estimate by a hulking $12 billion, the AP reports.

But 70-year-old Ronald Brockmeyer has another problem: more than $170,000 in outstanding taxes, the Guardian reports. According to tax liens filed by the IRS, Brockmeyer's federal debts include tens of thousands in personal income taxes, and tens more in employer taxes for his law firm and a yearly tax bosses pay to support the unemployed. On the bright side, he recently paid off three unpaid bills that come to $64,599. The judge, who owns three properties around St. Louis, didn't respond to several Guardian phone calls and emails seeking comment. The Dept. of Justice says he's a top player in Ferguson's strategy of generating revenue through its municipal court—which is blamed for ruining relations between the city's mostly black residents and white officials. Brockmeyer's court has allegedly jailed poor people who couldn't pay fines, and he's admitted to inventing court fees that are often  widely considered abusive and may be unlawful,  investigators say. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that like others in St. Louis County's court system, Brockmeyer is a judge one day and prosecutor the next—which some legal experts say creates a conflict of interest.

Boys get hit more than girls, and black children were paddled at a disproportionate rate compared to whites. It's a long-standing (and legal) disciplinary tradition in the state that locals don't seem terribly motivated to change: The National Education Association wants the practice banned, but the Alabama Education Association has stayed mum—despite the fact that it's illegal to paddle an adult in the state, per an opinion piece on AL.com. UNICEF's  Violence Against Children  report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 Supreme Court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it—and in 1995, Alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so.

Four cops opened fire on Vassell in Brooklyn on Wednesday after 911 calls came in saying a man was pointing a silver firearm at people; after Vassell was shot, it was revealed the supposed gun was really a metal pipe with a showerhead attached, per NPR. The NYPD released transcripts Thursday from the 911 calls, as well as security camera footage from the Crown Heights neighborhood where the shooting took place. In the video, Vassell approaches several people on the street—including what appears to be an adult with a child—and aims what many believed to be a firearm at them.  He looks like he's crazy, but he's pointing something at people that looks like a gun and he's like popping it as if … he's pulling the trigger,  one 911 transcript reads. The city's medical examiner found Vassell was shot nine times; NYPD Chief Terence Monahan says his officers fired 10 times. That, along with the fact that Vassell was known to local cops to be mentally ill—his father tells the New York Times his son had bipolar disorder—has residents especially upset. Witnesses say the police seemed to start firing right away upon confronting Vassell; Monahan says the officers fired after Vassell took a  two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers.  The Times notes while there were local beat cops who'd previously dealt with Vassell and knew of his mental illness, the officers who responded Wednesday to this more urgent call were reportedly not familiar with him— a hole in the neighborhood policing model,  per a Columbia professor.

Now his Liberal government is apparently about to make good on that vow: Per the CBC, pot will be legalized throughout the entire country by July 1, 2018, with legislation on the issue to be unveiled on April 10. (The Toronto Star cites another report that says the pot holiday 4/20 may be the target date, though the Globe and Mail notes the House of Commons will be on break during 4/20 week.) While quality control over the cannabis will fall to the federal government for safety reasons, and licensing will come out of Ottawa, each Canadian province will wield control over cost, distribution, and where pot can be sold. The nationwide age to legally buy marijuana will be set at 18, though provinces will be able to up that minimum. The legislation follows recommendations in a 106-page report by a federal task force. This may slow the roll of Trudeau's political opponents—specifically the New Democrats—who've recently tried to nail the prime minister for breaking his campaign promise, which some have insinuated was made just to get votes. This premise has been helped along by the fact that Trudeau has remained firm on  [enforcing] the law  as it stands now, including hitting illegal pot dispensaries with criminal charges, the Star has reported. Although the latest news may boost Trudeau's credibility, a senior federal official tells the Globe that crafting the legislation is  big and complicated,  with  lots of moving parts,  and there have been rumblings that pot that's legal for recreational users may not happen until 2019 due to the complexities.

"(Apr 3, 2019  8:20 AM CDT) As the Trump administration continues to try to dismantle ObamaCare, with a GOP plan now not expected until after the 2020 election, some sobering statistics have emerged underscoring the necessity for affordable health care. Per the New York Times, a survey released Tuesday by Gallup and the West Health nonprofit shows about 25% of respondents have held off on medical treatment because of the cost, while 45% are afraid they'll go bankrupt in the event of a  major health event,  per a release. Another big number from the survey, which polled 3,500 US adults by phone in early 2019: the $88 billion Americans have borrowed over the past year to pay for health care.  Our data shows an American public that's beaten down from this really serious issue,  a Gallup researcher tells the Times. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they're  completely  or  mostly  satisfied with the current health-care system based on their own experiences, though that number plunges to 39% when asked how well the system takes care of Americans in general. There's also a schism between Republicans and Democrats, with 67% of self-identified GOPers saying the US system is the best or one of the best in the world, while only 38% of Democrats say the same. However,  there is very little that separates the groups when it comes to the real-life consequences of the high cost of health care on their everyday lives,  Tim Lash, West Health's chief strategy officer, says in the release.  The time has come to take politics out of the equation and deal with the realities of the health care cost crisis with bipartisan and common-sense solutions that serve all Americans.",Health Care Costs Sent Americans Into $88B Debt in Last Year,Health Care Costs Sent Americans Into $____B Debt in Last Year,88,Copy( 88 ),0
"(Oct 9, 2015  1:21 PM CDT) A student was killed and another person was wounded in a shooting outside a Texas Southern University student-housing complex on Friday, and police detained at least two people for questioning, authorities said. The university quickly went on lockdown after the shooting was reported around 11:30am in a parking lot at the University Courtyard Apartments, which is on the edge of the Houston campus. Students and teachers were told to stay inside until the lockdown was lifted Friday afternoon, after two men were detained, but police said no charges have been filed. University President John Rudley said the student who was killed was a freshman, but that his name and age haven't been released. The second victim, whose name also hasn't been released, was shot twice and is hospitalized in stable condition, Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said. Silva said investigators were still searching for a motive, but that police weren't treating it as an  active shooter  investigation. The incident occurred just hours after another shooting near the same housing complex, though it's unclear whether the shootings were related. Classes were cancelled following the lockdown Friday. Rudley said classes will resume on a normal schedule Monday. The university said in a statement that an earlier shooting occurred early Friday morning, and that the school was increasing police presence on campus. Police said one person was treated and released for a minor wound, but it's unclear if the two incidents were linked. The university has about 9,700 students.

"(Dec 29, 2015  8:24 AM) Donald Trump has made a big to-do about spending next to nothing so far in his presidential campaign, but that may be changing. Sources in his camp tell Fox News he plans to kick off a major ad blitz, spending up to $2 million a week or more. This would mark a big change: Even though his campaign budgeted $25 million for TV ads for 2015's third quarter, Fox says it spent nothing—in Q3 or Q4. The first set of ads will reportedly jump right into where Trump stands on the issues, and they may also be reserved to swing back at rivals.  If you attack Trump, he will attack you 10 times as hard,  a Trump adviser tells Fox. The Hill notes Jeb Bush and John Kasich could be two targets, as they've gone on the offensive against Trump the most—for example, a Bush super PAC ponied up more than $3 million earlier this month for an ad aimed at Trump. And that's not the only big news in Donald's domain. Politico reports that multiple sources have confirmed a deal struck between Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee that gives his campaign access to the RNC's voter files, said to harbor data on more than 200 million Americans—data Politico notes is  critical for identifying and mobilizing persuadable voters.  Although the details aren't yet clear, the site reports the RNC typically ensures that campaigns it list-shares with are well versed in data operations. The list-sharing agreement also stipulates that candidates pledge to support the eventual party nominee.

The Apple-1 being sold at Charitybuzz appears to be a rare prototype likely hand-finished by Steve Jobs himself four decades ago, reports Recode. In fact, it is  quite possibly the first Apple-1 ever created,  says the site. With three days left, the top bid was $505,000 on Monday morning, but given the lineage of this one—and the fact that the last Apple-1 up for auction fetched $900,000—it won't be a big surprise if the million-dollar barrier is broken, notes CNET.

The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the fourth-quarter increase in the gross domestic product, the economy’s total output of goods and services, matched the 2.1% gain of the third quarter. Both quarters were well below the 3.1% surge seen in the first quarter. For the October-December quarter, growth was supported by solid but slower consumer spending and an improvement in the trade deficit. Those factors offset a further drop in business investment in new plants and equipment and a slowdown in restocking store shelves.

Police say visitors picked up €50 notes after an elastic band keeping the bag closed melted off during a brutal heat wave (the AP reports a record 104.5-degree temp was recorded Sunday).  There are decent and honest citizens who immediately informed the police,  says the town's mayor, per the news outlet NDR. There is also a man—the campsite's owner—who has stepped forward to lay claim to the money, and police are investigating his claim.

The price of Synacthen Depot increased by more than 2,000% from $33.05 per vial to $680 per vial,  says a spokesperson for Alberta Health, which delisted the drug in July.

He was trying to get it with the fishing net, and (the bird) jumped on the first wine bottle. When that happened, I was like, 'Aw, this is about to be a big mess,'  Ghanem said.  It just went straight diving into all the bottles. The more he kept on trying to use the net, the more it kept on flapping its wings and knocking everything over.  At one point, cellphone video taken by Ghanem shows the officer catching a wine bottle in the net as the bird crashes through a shelf and a dozen bottles shatter to the ground. Unable to watch more destruction, Ghanem puts on a sweatshirt to protect himself from the bird's claws and helps the officer ensnare it. He said they took the bird outside, unharmed. In all, Ghanem said the peahen was in the store for 90 minutes and broke $500 worth of the family store's best bottles.",Peacock Racks Up $500 Bill at Liquor Store,Peacock Racks Up $____ Bill at Liquor Store,500,Copy( 500 ),0
"(May 11, 2018  8:58 AM CDT) The subject of rent control has prompted some big headlines over the past few years, but one out of Manhattan will likely cause fellow city dwellers' jaws to drop. A New York Times obituary notes that in March, 84-year-old Patricia O'Grady was hit by a car near her Greenwich Village home and died of her injuries. Her apartment, however, is what's causing a buzz, after the New York Post reported the late actress was paying around what it costs for a week's worth of Starbucks lattes as monthly rent: $28.43, to be exact. Landlord Adam Pomerantz, who bought the apartment building in 2002, raised O'Grady's rent just once, from the $26.45 she was paying when he bought the building, after he consulted a rent-control worksheet. The apartment, which O'Grady moved into in 1955 with three other young actresses, could possibly be NYC's last cold-water flat, with no heat or hot water and with sparse updates—at her insistence.  What you're doing to me is torturing me. Please leave the apartment as is,  is what she reportedly told Pomerantz when he once tried to install a real heating system for her.  I didn't even know that [cold-water flats] existed anymore,  the head of the Metropolitan Council on Housing tells the Post in amazement. Pomerantz's plans for the apartment now: fix it up and try to get around $5,000 a month for it. The Post has photos of the apartment here.",She Died at 84.

"(Jul 23, 2015  2:53 AM CDT) There has been a steep rise in bison attacks on humans in Yellowstone National Park this year, which may be connected to a rise in visitors trying to take selfies or other close-up photos of the animals. The latest injured visitor—the fifth this year—is a 43-year-old woman from Mississippi who was charged by a bison Tuesday near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. She and her daughter turned their backs on the creature from roughly 6 yards away to get a photo with the bison in the background, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The National Park Service says the pair started to run when they heard the animal's footsteps, but it caught the woman and threw her in the air. The bison moved on after the woman's father came to her aid. Her family drove her to a clinic, where she was treated for minor injuries.  The family said they read the warnings in both the park literature and the signage, but saw other people close to the bison, so they thought it would be OK,  a ranger tells CNN.  People need to recognize that Yellowstone wildlife is wild, even though they seem docile. This woman was lucky that her injuries were not more severe.  The park, which tells visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from the animals, usually sees only one or two such incidents a year, and the rise in attacks could also be linked to a rise in visitor numbers, a spokeswoman tells the AP. Two of the other people attacked—a 62-year-old Australian visitor and a 16-year-old girl from Taiwan—were also trying to take bison photos.

What's more, the astronomers believe there are many, many more roaming free about the Milky Way, possibly twice the number of stars in the galaxy, reports Time. The new findings could shed more light on how planets form.  The implications of this discovery are profound,  writes a member of the Center for Astronomy in Germany in an accompanying Nature article. Scientists have long speculated that such rogue planets could exist, with one theory being that they got flung away from their own systems because of a too-close-encounter with another planet, explains Bloomberg.

Shirley Player, 61, stole about $92,000 a year between 2007 and 2014 from the real estate company she worked for to  settle debts, pay rents, and [buy] 'family treats,'  a prosecutor at her trial said in court—and it was all because  she had not expected to be still here,  the attorney added. One of Player's defense attorneys told the court that she was simply trying to plan ahead for her almost-certain demise, the Daily Express reports.  She told me she had wanted to do something for her family as she was not going to be here much longer,  he said.  I asked her where the money went. She does not know.  Player was said to have made 390 transactions into four separate accounts over the seven-year period, hiding them as  tenant deposit returns,  the Daily Mail notes. The theft was eventually discovered this year during a company audit. Player was also maybe relying too heavily on prescience: Even though she didn't have cancer when she started her stealing spree—she wasn't diagnosed until 2010—Player had had two sisters who succumbed to cancer and figured it was only a matter of time before she did, too. Even Player's husband, Malcolm, says he had no clue about the pilfered cash until the cops came calling.  We weren't driving around in Bentleys and drinking champagne,  he says.

"(Oct 25, 2011  7:40 AM CDT) It's one of astronomy's oldest mysteries—Chinese astronomers in AD 185 discovered a  guest star  that appeared in the sky for about eight months. Modern scientists have for decades believed it to be the first documented sighting of a supernova, but what kind of supernova was it? At long last, astronomers know. The ancient astral explosion was in fact a Type Ia supernova—a star about the same size as our sun that shriveled into a white dwarf, then emptied all the matter around it in space, siphoned off a nearby star, and exploded in an unusually large and rapid nova, reports Space.com. Now called RCW 86, the star once sat about 8,000 light years from Earth. Researchers used two NASA telescopes to measure the temperature of the exploded star's  guts  still in space—which would appear larger than a full moon if they were visible to the naked eye—and determined how much gas had to be in the star that created the supernova.  This supernova remnant got really big, really fast,  said the astronomer who led the study of the supernova.  It's two to three times bigger than we would expect for a supernova that was witnessed exploding nearly 2,000 years ago.

The board gave Paladino 24 hours to resign over what it called  unambiguously racist  and  morally repugnant  remarks about the Obamas he made last week, reports the Huffington Post. Paladino, who unsuccessfully ran for governor as a Republican in 2010, told Buffalo weekly Artvoice that he wanted to see President Obama die of mad cow disease in 2017, and for Michelle Obama to  return to being a male  and live in a cave in Zimbabwe with a gorilla. The board said that if Paladino won't quit, it will petition New York Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia to remove him, the Buffalo News reports.  Words matter, Mr. Paladino,  said School Board President Barbara Seals Nevergold at a raucous meeting Thursday, which Paladino did not attend.  The impact on children of color, especially African-American children, is incalculable,  she said.  They would like me to tell you, 'You're fired.'  Other board members accused Paladino of racism and other misconduct going back many years. Paladino, who has said he won't step down, issued a statement accusing the board of trying to get rid of him for exposing corruption.

The killings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a US-owned factory in France that included a beheading. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after the ISIS militants urged their followers  to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers.  In all, at least 63 people were killed. Sousse, some 90 miles from Tunis, is a popular resort for both Tunisians and Europeans. Gary Pine, a British tourist, describes his experience with today's attack to Sky News. He says he and his family were on the beach and thought fire crackers were being set off.  There was a mass exodus off the beach,  he says, noting that his son said he had seen someone get shot on the beach. Pine said guests at his hotel were first told to lock themselves in their rooms and later to gather in the lobby.

Long-term damage was far greater than federal officials let on after a drum filled with radioactive waste blew up at the nation’s only underground dump near Carlsbad in February 2014, a Times investigation finds, and the bill could top $2 billion—rivaling the cleanup after nation’s worst nuclear accident at Three Mile island in 1979. And with the New Mexico dump still offline, thousands of tons of radioactive waste are sitting in other states, delaying processing and angering local officials.  There is no question the Energy Department has downplayed the significance of the accident,  Don Hancock of the watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center, told the Times. Promises by the Energy Department to quickly reopen the dump, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, have led to  poor safety practices  during the cleanup, reports the Santa Fe New Mexican. The facility, which lies in salt caverns 2,000 feet below ground, was set to reopen in March, though the feds knew when they set that date they had a 1% chance of hitting it, an audit found. The dump is now set to reopen in December. Kitty litter was blamed for the blast, which blew the top off a drum filled with plutonium and americium waste. But that wasn't the only failing: Feds found some two dozen lapses at the dump, including the filtration system. As a result, some 35% of the ground area was contaminated and 21 workers exposed to low doses of radiation, per the Times.

"(Aug 20, 2012  8:46 AM CDT) General Motors and Isuzu are recalling more than 258,000 SUVs after getting reports of 28 fires apparently caused by short-circuits in the cars' power windows and door locks. The recall covers many vehicle makes from the 2006 and 2007 model years, including the Chevy TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender, and Saab 97-X, the AP reports. Though there haven't been reports of injuries, the blazes have been fairly dramatic.  The fire burned the entire driver's side of the vehicle, a portion of the front passenger seat, and the roof,  explained one woman whose car caught fire in her driveway. The danger exists primarily in states that use salts and other chemicals to clear their roads of ice. Those chemicals can get inside the driver's door, corroding the circuits and ultimately causing them to short out and catch fire, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Take your car back to the dealer, and it'll replace the switches free of charge.","Fire Hazard Forces GM, Isuzu to Recall 258K SUVs","Fire Hazard Forces GM, Isuzu to Recall ____K SUVs",258,"Paraphrase( 258,000 , K )",1

"(Jan 14, 2017  11:37 AM) It's kind of like Netflix, but with Cadillacs instead of movies. The car company is experimenting with a modern twist on car ownership: Don't own at all and instead try out a new vehicle every month or close to it. In a press release, the company says it launching a  subscription  month-to-month car service it's calling BOOK. Those who participate can drive a new model for up to 60 days before turning it in, and they can max out at 18 different cars a year. It's not cheap, however, at $1,500 a month.  BOOK is aimed squarely at Gen X and Y customers who want the experience of a luxury vehicle without the hassles of traditional ownership,  a company executive tells Vocativ. BOOK debuts Feb. 1 in the New York City metro area, where car ownership rates are falling and people might want to take different members of a fleet out and about at their leisure without having to worry about selling it down the road, reports Quartz. Leasing a Cadillac costs much less—figure between $300 and $750—but with no mileage limits, and no handling of registration, taxes, maintenance, or insurance (though there is a $750 deductible in the event of an accident), the company is hoping the service paves the way for car subscriptions and finds success in other US markets, like Los Angeles.

In an ad to be published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Monday, Flynt notes that Williams settled a sexual harassment lawsuit out of court in 1998 and demands that Carson  disavow any and all relations  with him, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Flynt warns that if Carson doesn't fire Williams, the Hustler publisher will pay between $50,000 and $1 million for information on the  curious relationship  Williams had with Stephen Gregory, the personal trainer who sued him. Flynt's offer is the latest in a long line of his cash offers to expose alleged hypocrisy among conservatives, including a 2012 offer to pay for proof of  infidelity, sexual impropriety, or corruption  among members of Congress, and a 2011 offer of $1 million for anybody who could prove Rick Perry had an affair, the Reporter notes. There has been no response yet from Carson, who recently threatened to leave the Republican Party if GOP leaders resort to backroom deals to choose a nominee at a brokered convention.

Basically, people are driving around with ticking time bombs,  a mechanic tells WMUR. The reasons vary: In some cases, drivers may have ignored multiple notices to have their vehicles fixed. In others, cars may have changed hands several times over the years, making it difficult for the notice to reach the current driver. The Post, for instance, tells the story of a 26-year-old woman killed nearly four years ago while driving a 2001 Honda Civic that had been turned into a rental car.

They needed to come down,  says Mayor Catherine Pugh.  My concern is for the safety and security of our people. We moved as quickly as we could.  Overshadowing the move, of course, is the violence in Charlottesville, Va., that revolved around the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee. One of the statues that came down in Baltimore was of Lee with fellow Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. It had stood in a city park since 1948, notes the New York Times. Also coming down was a Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, another honoring Confederate women, and one in tribute to former Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 decreeing that even free blacks had no right to citizenship. Pugh said the city is still figuring out where the statues will end up. In North Carolina, meanwhile, a 22-year-old woman who helped topple a Confederate statue faces felony charges, reports the Herald Sun.

Now she's suing Tokyo's city government, which oversees the police, along with her agent and the attacker, for nearly $700,000.  I would like police to realize that if they fail to respond adequately, it could result in something similar to what happened to me,  she tells Asahi Shumbun. Police apparently shrugged it off when obsessed fan Tomohiro Iwazaki sent her more than 400 threatening tweets before the attack. Police also declined her request for protection two days before a concert in a Tokyo suburb. Attacked on her way there, Tomita was left partly blind in one eye with a list of health woes including PTSD and problems singing and eating.

It is difficult to return to what life was like before the incident.  Iwazaki was sentenced to more than 14 years for the attack.

"(Jun 24, 2013  10:39 AM CDT) Some $829 million in  improper payments,  including those involving fraud and clerical errors, went out to Pell grant recipients over the fiscal year that ended in September. Though that's a smaller figure than in the previous two years, it's up 86% from 2007—and the US is trying to root out the problem. Many applicants are applying for cash without planning to attend school at all; officials have flagged 126,000 questionable applicants since January, the Wall Street Journal reports. That's some 1% of aid applicants for the 2013-2014 academic year. Some of the fraud can be chalked up to organized crime, says the education department's inspector general: Last year, more than 34,000 in crime rings improperly got student cash. For the department, the biggest red flag is the receipt of aid for at least three schools in the same year. Officials tell schools about their concerns, and the schools seek further records from the applicant.  What we find are very poor students academically that are borrowing to the max, getting the maximum in their Pell grant and just going from school to school,  says a financial aid director at Maryland's Anne Arundel Community College. Adds another:  We have individuals that told me, 'I spent all this money on graduate school. I can't get a job. I can't afford to live, I need the money.'

"(Feb 24, 2014  7:00 PM) The FBI was created 43 years after Abraham Lincoln's death, and yet his assassin has ... an FBI file? Yep, a file was opened into John Wilkes Booth in 1922 and was still active as late as 1977, Smithsonian reports. The blog Wonders & Marvels got hold of the file, and shares some highlights. The file was started when a Missourian wrote bureau Director William J. Burns saying that Booth—rumored by some to still be alive—was either the man's neighbor or corresponding with his neighbor. Burns replied that he believed the  official records  and saw no need for further action. Yet another letter the following year prompted Burns to read a book about Booth's alleged escape, and Burns found that it had  very strong evidence in support of the old belief that Booth did escape and live many years.  (Still, there's no evidence of Burns following up on it.) In 1948, the FBI received the boot Booth wore when he killed Lincoln (a doctor removed it from his injured left leg), but an ultraviolet and infrared examination of writing in the boot couldn't make heads or tails of it. Finally, in 1977, the FBI scanned Booth's diary in search of invisible writing, and couldn't find any. The FBI did confirm what had been known since 1867, though: twenty-seven sheets were missing from it. The diary can still be seen at Ford's Theatre Museum. (In other Lincoln news, a report found in a box at the National Archives in 2012 revealed how the first doctor to reach the shot president reacted.)",FBI Investigated Lincoln's Killer ... in 1977,FBI Investigated Lincoln's Killer ... in ____,1977,Copy( 1977 ),0

"(Jul 25, 2012  9:16 AM CDT) William Staub, who took the treadmill—that ubiquitous piece of exercise equipment that is loved and loathed by millions—into homes and gyms, died Thursday at his Clifton, NJ, home. He was 96 and had been spied on a treadmill as recently as two months ago. Staub, a mechanical engineer, built and marketed his first treadmill in the late 1960s—40 steel rollers covered by an orange belt, a gray cover over the motor, and orange dials to determine time and speed. Staub envisioned it as a tool for people who wanted to run or walk outside but didn't because of inclement weather, less-than-ideal circumstances, or creative excuses, his son says. At the time, the treadmill was almost exclusively used by doctors, adds Dr. Kenneth Cooper, a health and fitness pioneer who used the machine to perform stress tests. Staub, who didn't exercise at the time, read Cooper's 1968 book Aerobics, which espoused the health benefits of exercise. The book mentioned a treadmill, and Staub wanted to develop it commercially so people could run indoors.  The treadmills we were using were very expensive, but there wasn't one on the market for the masses. And that's why he said, 'We need this,'  Cooper says.  I encouraged it. I said, 'If you can develop a treadmill that could be used in a home or an apartment it would be a slam dunk.'

The snowboarder, currently trying to qualify for the February games in Pyeongchang, needed 62 stitches after hitting his face off the edge of a half pipe during training in New Zealand in October. A video published Wednesday by Yahoo Sports shows the impact and blood-soaked snow before White is flown away in a helicopter with a bloodied face.  I scared myself,  White says later from a hospital bed.  I haven't really had that much blood coming out of me before.  Months later, White is back on his feet following surgery.  My health is great,  he told USA Today last month, adding his injuries were  definitely jarring more mentally than physically.   Having to wake up and look in the mirror and I have this big scar on my forehead and stuff, it's definitely not fun. It's a reminder,  he continued. But will White—who has twice won gold medals in half pipe—be able to compete at what could be his last Olympics? That could depend on upcoming qualifying events in Snowmass, Colo., and Mammoth Mountain, Calif., where White will be vying for a top-two finish. Riders usually need only a top-three finish to make the US team—something White has already achieved—but a deep American bench means  more riders are likely to do that than there are spots,  USA Today explains.

"(Jan 31, 2017  8:01 AM) President Trump's travel ban remains in place, but nearly 900 refugees are getting a reprieve. Per a Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters, the State Department and DHS have OKed 872 waivers for refugees who were already  in transit  when Trump's order left his desk Friday, leaving scores stuck at airports around the world. The document doesn't mention what countries the refugees originate from, but an anonymous DHS official confirms the waivers and says those who will benefit from them had already gone through the stringent US vetting procedure, which usually takes about two years. Trump's order put a stop to all refugee entry for 120 days (Syrian refugees indefinitely), and put tough limitations on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The point of temporarily suspending the refugee program here, per the most recent update to the DHS website, is to give DHS and  interagency partners  the chance to  review screening procedures.  Reuters notes that refugees fleeing to the US have often given everything up back home (homes, jobs, possessions), meaning it could be especially problematic to send them back to their originating countries. Per the DHS document, 348 visa holders were kept from getting onto US-bound planes over the weekend, while over 200 people made it into US airports but were then detained. Nearly 740 people were questioned by US Customs and Border Protection authorities at the airports—almost 400 of them being legal US green-card holders.

"(Sep 5, 2018  6:21 AM CDT) British prosecutors charged two Russian men Wednesday with the nerve agent poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The Crown Prosecution Service said the men, known to British investigators as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are charged in absentia with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, and use of the nerve agent Novichok, reports the AP. Russian law forbids extradition of its own citizens, but Britain has issued a European Arrest Warrant, meaning the suspects can be detained if they leave Russia for another European country. Assistant police commissioner Neil Basu conceded it was  very very unlikely  police would be in a position to arrest them any time soon. Police say the men, both about 40, flew to London on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned March 4. Basu said they were probably using aliases. Basu appealed to the public  to come forward and tell us who they are.  Police released images of the men as they traveled through London and Salisbury between March 2 and March 4. Police say the two men flew back to Moscow from Heathrow on the evening of March 4, hours after the Skripals were found collapsed on a park bench. Police believe the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a perfume bottle and applied to Skripal's front door of Sergei Skripal's house. The bottle was found by a local man, Charlie Rowley, in June; he was hospitalized and his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, died. Police haven't determined where the bottle was between poisonings, and aren't ready to bring charges in the second poisoning.

Duarte has been fighting legal battles since 2012, when he hired someone to plow 450 acres of land he had purchased near Red Bluff in central California, USA Today reports. Because the area included wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers ordered work to stop and sued Duarte for failing to obtain a permit and for allegedly carrying out  deep ripping  that went as far as 3 feet down, disturbing waters considered to be  waters of the United States  under federal regulations.

From 1980 to 2010 (the most recent available year), those earning more than $200,000 have enjoyed the largest decline in total taxes as a percentage of income, and 85% of households earning more than $25,000 per year have also seen the percentage of their income that goes to taxes drop. The group that got hit hardest? Those earning less than $25,000, only about half of which have seen their tax burden decline. While federal tax rates have been cut across the board since 1980, state and local taxes (which typically take a larger percentage of the lowest earners' income) have increased in most of the country, offsetting much of the federal savings—in six states, local tax increases have exceeded the decline in federal rates. Overall, about 31 cents of each dollar earned goes to the government, about the same as in 1980. However, changes to the tax code have seen the taxes paid by a household earning $350,000 fall to 42.1% from 49% (adjusted for inflation). While a household making $22,000 in 2010 paid a much lower percentage—19.4%—that's much closer to what it was for that household in 1980: 20.2%.","If It Was 1980, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes","If It Was ____, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes",1980,Copy( 1980 ),0

He covered the Iraq war for Newsweek from 2005 until 2008, and wrote I Lost My Love in Baghdad: A Modern War Story after his fiance was killed by a car bomb in 2007.  Great reporters exude a certain kind of electricity,  says Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana,  the sense that there are stories burning inside them, and that there's no higher calling or greater way to live life than to be always relentlessly trying to find and tell those stories.

The boy, now 17, is paralyzed from severe spinal injuries inflicted when the soldier dropped his rifle at a Basra base in 2003. He is receiving round-the-clock care in Britain and will never be able to return to Iraq. The payment is much higher than any awarded to any injured British soldier. The large amount is due to the level of negligence involved, said a government spokesman, who stressed that it was unlikely to set a precedent.

That's up 2 points since last year and a whopping 10 points since 1999.  More than ever, the SAT reflects the diversity of students in our nation's classrooms,  says the president of the College Board, which crafts the test. Overall scores (out of 2,400) fell 1 point each in critical reading (501) and writing (493), while math remained the same (515). Though watchers applaud the diversity of the test-taking populace, some are still troubled by the inequality of scores between different racial and socioeconomic groups. For instance, students from families making more than $200,000 saw their scores improve an average of 26 points, while kids from $60,000 households held steady.

"(Jan 10, 2017  1:14 PM) If 22 years in prison seems harsh for stealing a TV remote control, Eric Bramwell probably agrees—but, based on his past criminal history, authorities in Illinois say it's a well-deserved sentence. Per the Chicago Tribune, the 35-year-old Melrose Park man was handed his fate on Wednesday by DuPage County Judge Robert Miller after being found guilty in November for stealing a remote from a Wheaton apartment complex's common area. But prosecutors say other burglaries of other remotes—and actual TV sets—he committed in six suburbs dating back to 2014 were what allowed for the extended sentence, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.  Mr. Bramwell's illegal activity and his history have finally caught up with him,  said State's Attorney Robert Berlin. What finally did Bramwell in: A glove was dropped during the August 1, 2015, remote disappearance, and the DNA from the glove matched with Bramwell's, whose records were in a database for convicted felons. At 17, Bramwell was nabbed by Franklin Park cops and admitted to being the  ringleader  in a series of home break-ins that netted him and his accomplices jewelry, power tools, and other items they could pawn. Bramwell—who received an additional six months in jail from Judge Miller in November for uttering profanities in court—will need to put in 11 years behind bars before he's up for parole.  Regardless of what was stolen, Mr. Bramwell repeatedly thumbed his nose at the law,  said Berlin.

While authorities aren't confirming the identify of the remains, Patty Wetterling and another source tell the Minneapolis Star Tribune the remains are those of Wetterling's son Jacob, who disappeared when he was 11.  Our hearts are broken,  Wetterling says.  We have no words.  The remains were found with information from Danny Heinrich, a 52-year-old man arrested last October on child pornography charges and a person of interest in Jacob's disappearance.  I am happy for them that they know, not that he’s passed, but at least they have closure,  Heinrich's brother tells KARE. Jacob was on the way back from the store with his friend and brother in 1989 when they were accosted by a masked man with a gun. The man had the other boys run into the woods and is believed to have kidnapped Jacob. Heinrich says he had nothing to do with Jacob's disappearance, but DNA evidence tied him to the sexual assault of another boy around the same time and place. The statute of limitations has passed on that crime, so no charges were filed, but Heinrich became a person of interest in Jacob's disappearance due to similarities in the incidents. In the wake of his disappearance, Jacob's family created the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center for families of lost children.

By August 18, due to a bank error that allowed him to withdraw unlimited amounts of cash, Page had withdrawn a whopping $1,543,104 that he didn't actually have—putting his account into serious overdraft, which finally clued the bank in to what was going on.

"(Dec 14, 2011  12:36 PM) Roughly 2.5 million people between the ages of 19 and 25 have gained health insurance since President Obama signed his health care reform bill, more than double the 1 million the White House had been expecting, according to a new administration analysis. The bump is almost entirely due to a provision in a law that allows young people to remain on their parents' coverage until age 26. Before the law took effect, almost 36% of 19- to 25-year-olds lacked insurance, either because they couldn't find work that offered it to them, or they passed because they didn't think they'd need it. As of the second quarter, that had fallen to 27%. The bad news?

Oh, and they'll end up fatter than people 20 to 40 years ago even if they eat and exercise the same, according to a study in Obesity Research & Clinical Practice. The Atlantic reports that after looking at data from nearly 51,000 Americans, researchers concluded that a person in 2006 eating and exercising the same as someone of an identical age in 1988 had a BMI about 2.3 points higher, meaning they'd be about 10% heavier.  Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you'd have to eat even less and exercise more than those older to prevent gaining weight,  Jennifer Kuk of York University in Toronto says in the story. Researchers have three thoughts on why that could be, the Atlantic reports. First, we're exposed to more chemicals nowadays, which could be inducing weight gain. Second, prescription drug use is way up, and antidepressants especially have been linked to weight gain. Finally, hormones, antibiotics, or artificial sweeteners in meat and other foods could be changing the bacteria in our guts and hampering weight loss. Kuk says this research is a good reason to be more empathetic to people of all body types.  Ultimately, maintaining a healthy body weight is now more challenging than ever,  she says in a York press release.

"(Nov 8, 2018  6:33 PM) The UN’s Global Strategy for Plant Conservation program has set a 2020 deadline for conserving 75% of the world’s threatened plant species outside of their natural habitat. But, based on the results of a new study, the prospects of meeting that target aren’t very good. According to a paper published earlier this month in Nature Plants, 36% of  critically endangered  species produce recalcitrant seeds, meaning that they can’t survive being dried out. And that means that they aren't candidates for the traditional seed banking process, Phys.org reports. The study, performed by scientists affiliated with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also found that 35% of  vulnerable  species and 27% of  endangered  species generate seeds that cannot be banked using the common method of freezing them at about -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Among them are trees such as oak, avocado, cacao, and mango.  As successful as seed banking is for some species, it is not suitable for all seed plants and we need to invest in other ways to safeguard recalcitrant seeds,  says study co-author John Dickie, per Earth.com. One of those other ways to preserve recalcitrant seeds may be cryopreservation, which involves removing the embryo from a seed and freezing it at about -320 degrees Fahrenheit using liquid nitrogen. Per Phys.org, Kew has been using cryopreservation at its Millennium Seed Bank for years and is planning to develop a protocol to  kick-start large-scale use  of the method.

The New York Times paints a fascinating picture of a country that is no stranger to grisly murders and honor killings, but one in which capital punishment is an extremely rare occurrence, where even prison officials will sometimes help prisoners draft appeals. About 50 people have been hanged since 1947, the last in 2004. But after one prisoner’s last-chance appeal was rejected, the state of Assam found itself in need of an executioner. It looked to the state of Uttar Pradesh, which was known to have several hangmen. One had hanged one of the assassins of Indira Gandhi, but he died several years ago. Another had a broken arm. A third died May 19—but his son was interested in joining the family business.

"(Sep 17, 2019  12:27 AM CDT) The first sexual experience for 1 in 16 US women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a new study suggests. The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn't use the word in asking women about forced sex. Almost 7% of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older, per the AP. Almost half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down, and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will. The results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. The new study is an analysis of responses from 13,310 adult women who participated in nationally representative US government health surveys from 2011-2017, before the Me Too movement.  Any sexual encounter (with penetration) that occurs against somebody's will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it's just as much rape,  says lead author Dr. Laura Hawks, a Harvard Medical School researcher. In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and reproductive health problems than women whose first sexual experience wasn't forced. Other studies have found long-term effects of sexual assault may include social isolation, feelings of powerlessness, stigmatization, poor self-image, and risky behavior, which all may increase risks for mental health problems, a journal editorial said.","For 7% of US Women, First Sex Experience Isn't Voluntary","For ____% of US Women, First Sex Experience Isn't Voluntary",7,Copy( 7 ),0
"(Oct 12, 2008  8:30 PM CDT) Tumbling stock markets have cracked open the piggy bank that many Americans use to store retirement savings—401(k) accounts—sparking fresh debate about how best to save money, the Washington Post reports. Supporters argue that 401(k)s offer bigger rewards than traditional pensions, which are less exposed to market turbulence. But they lose more on average too—between 7.2% and 11.2% over the last year. Critics argue that plummeting 401(k)s hurt the economy in other ways, like forcing people to work past age 65, freezing young people out of the job market.   That has a perverse effect on the business cycle,  one analyst said. Either way, experts advise against pulling out of your 401(k) unless you can't sleep at night.

"(Dec 19, 2011  11:03 AM) Touchscreens are so 2011. Starting as soon as next year, we'll be able to manipulate our phones with a wave of the hand. And that's just the beginning: Touch-free technology could soon take over our TVs, our tablets, and other devices, the BBC reports. One company behind the shift is Israel's XTR3D, which recently scored an $8 million investment; the firm expects the first touchless smartphone to hit the market in 2012. Such technology isn't, of course, entirely new: Microsoft's motion-detecting Kinect gaming system has been around since last year. But while Kinect uses a collection of sensors, microphones, and cameras to do its work, XTR3D's equipment simply uses 2D cameras like the one on your phone. But it goes beyond phones and TVs: It  can be installed into any consumer electronics device,  says a rep for the company; in fact, a computer loaded with XTR3D's software can be used to play a Kinect game.

"(May 31, 2012  12:23 AM CDT) There are four too many wives in the name of Five Wives vodka, according to the board that controls liquor sales in Idaho. State regulators say the vodka—which has a label featuring five women from an 1890s vaudeville act hiking up their skirts—is offensive both to women and to Mormons, who make up more than a quarter of the state's population, reports the Los Angeles Times. The brand won't be offered in stores run by the state liquor monopoly and bar owners have been banned from ordering it. The vodka is made by Ogden's Own distillery in Utah, where state regulators have allowed it to go on sale. The ban is absurd and unfair, says an exec at Ogden's, who notes that a Utah beer named Polygamy Porter is sold in Idaho. Liquor board officials counter that Idaho doesn't control what brands of beer go on sale, adding that a glut of new liquor products also contributed to the board's nixing of Five Wives. The distillery is making the most of the ban with a media campaign and sale of  Free the Five Wives  T-shirts, notes the AP.",Idaho Bans 'Offensive' 5 Wives Vodka,Idaho Bans 'Offensive' ____ Wives Vodka,5,Trans( five ),1
"(Mar 19, 2015  4:28 PM CDT) In a survival story his doctors call extraordinary, a 22-month-old Pennsylvania boy whose lifeless body was pulled from an icy creek was revived after an hour and 41 minutes of CPR and has suffered virtually no lingering effects. Gardell Martin came home from the hospital on Sunday, and his doctors said today he has made a full recovery.  It's not only extraordinarily rare that we got the kid back, but what's even more extraordinary is the rate at which he recovered and the completeness of his recovery,  said Dr. Frank Maffei, director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Geisinger's Janet Weis Children's Hospital in Danville. Gardell and two of his brothers had gone outside to play on March 11 when he fell into the stream that runs through their 5-acre property near Mifflinburg. A neighbor found Gardell nearly a quarter-mile away, caught up in a tree branch and water gushing around him. An ambulance crew arrived moments later, found no pulse, and began CPR. Resuscitation would continue, unbroken, for 101 minutes—in the ambulance, at a community hospital, aboard a medical helicopter and, finally, in the emergency room of Janet Weis. Gardell's body temperature was 77 degrees when he arrived, more than 20 degrees below normal. In this case, the boy's hypothermia worked to his advantage, slowing his metabolism and giving his organs  some degree of protection from cardiac arrest,  Maffei said. Knowing that, Maffei ordered CPR to continue while the team warmed his body. At around 82 degrees, they detected a pulse.","Toddler OK After Icy Plunge, 101 Minutes of CPR","Toddler OK After Icy Plunge, ____ Minutes of CPR",101,Copy( 101 ),0
"(Oct 14, 2015  11:18 AM CDT) In 2010, Randy Guijarro bought three old photographs he liked at a junk store in Fresno, Calif., for $2, including a 4-by-5-inch  tintype  showing a bunch of men playing croquet near a cabin in 1878. But not just any men—nearly a year of authentication proved that the photo shows Billy the Kid and members of his gang of outlaws, The Regulators, and now the picture (which, the Sacramento Bee notes, actually cost Guijarro only 88 cents) is going to auction and could sell for $5 million, USA Today reports.  When we first saw the photograph, we were understandably skeptical—an original Billy the Kid photo is the Holy Grail of Western Americana,  says the senior numismatist at Kagin's, the firm of experts that authenticated the tintype and will negotiate its sale. There's only one other known photo of Billy the Kid, taken in 1880, and that 2-by-3-inch tintype sold for $2.3 million in 2010. The process of authenticating the newly discovered picture of Billy (real name William Henry McCarty Jr. , though he also used the alias William H. Bonney) will be explored on a National Geographic special Sunday. It all started after Guijarro enlarged the image he'd bought and thought he recognized Billy the Kid and his best friends, Tom O'Folliard and Charlie Bowdre. Sallie Chisum is in the picture, too, ABC30 reports, and Fox News notes that research of her writings revealed the photo was taken after Bowdre's wedding.  We had to be certain that we could answer and verify where, when, how, and why this photograph was taken,  the numismatist says. Experts in digital facial recognition, antique photography, geographic positioning, and even vintage croquet sets were brought in and will be featured on the documentary.

When police found him, Sheen  was getting in everyone's face, frothing, paranoid,  a source tells the New York Daily News. His room was spattered with blood and broken chandelier glass, and the prostitute was reportedly also found naked, hiding in the closet. Sheen admitted using cocaine, sources say, and Radar reports he also tested positive for the drug. While the Daily News describes his companion as a  semipro  celebrity gold digger, Radar claims she’s definitely a prostitute—and that she’s the person Sheen accused of stealing his wallet during his meltdown.

There's a $1,200 check coming,  White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, per CNBC, adding,  It's a very well-rounded package.  Also included in this bill, which comes after a $3 trillion package proposed in May by House Democrats was rejected by the GOP-controlled Senate: an extension on the federal eviction moratorium, an extension on unemployment benefits, funding for school reopenings, and liability protections for businesses. There are still bones of contention, however. For example, although Democrats have sought to keep the $600-per-week addition to unemployment checks going, Republicans say it's too much and keeps people at home instead of working; their proposal calls for a 70% replacement of lost wages instead. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says that would cut the extra unemployment check down to about $200 per week, Vox notes. As for the eviction moratorium, critics point out it applies only to renters in buildings with government-backed mortgages, per USA Today, which cites Aspen Institute stats showing 20% of Americans living in rental households face eviction by the end of September.

Jay Darshane says he was  trying to help the police with their investigation  when officers showed up right after the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting at his restaurant, which WGN notes is located about 50 yards from where the fatal shots were fired. Darshane says the BK's assistant district manager called him that night to tell him there were  four or five  officers asking to review the eatery's surveillance video. Darshane gave the OK, and cops holed up with the tape for nearly two hours, he says—but when they left, there was an  inexplicable 86-minute gap,  from 9:13pm to 10:39pm, that included when Laquan was shot, the Tribune notes.  I didn't know they were going to delete it,  Darshane says, adding that he testified about the missing video earlier this year in front of a grand jury. But State's Attorney Anita Alvarez has said there's no forensic evidence to back up claims the tape was erased on purpose, and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy says those claims are  absolutely untrue  and that there were  apparently technical difficulties.  The Tribune notes that the surveillance camera probably wouldn't have had the vantage point to show Laquan's shooting, but it may have depicted some of the teen's movements right before. And an attorney for Laquan's family poses a question.  It is curious,  he says.  If [the officers] got there and turned it on and found that there was no video, what were they looking at for two hours?

That's effectively what people are doing when they quaff a product known as Miracle Mineral Solution, and other products like it that promise a cure for autism, cancer, HIV, hepatitis, flu, and other conditions, the Food and Drug Administration warns. NBC News notes such sodium chlorite elixirs, which turn into chlorine dioxide when mixed with citric acid activating agents, are often marketed on social media, without FDA approval and with potentially fatal side effects.  Ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach,  Ned Sharpless, the agency's acting commissioner, says in a release.  Consumers should not use these products, and parents should not give these products to their children for any reason.  The FDA, which has warned about the danger of such products for nearly a decade, says it has received new reports of side effects that include severe vomiting and diarrhea, acute liver failure, and dangerously low blood pressure from dehydration. NBC notes poison control centers have handled more than 16,000 cases over the last five years, with dozens of life-threatening scenarios and eight actual fatalities.

"(Sep 3, 2011  8:09 AM CDT) This year's saga of Apple's missing iPhone prototype is getting nearly as melodramatic as last year's. San Francisco police have changed their tune and now say  three or four  detectives accompanied private detectives hired by Apple to search a local home, reports the San Francisco Weekly. The officers remained outside while two Apple detectives entered the house to look for the iPhone 5 prototype, though the 22-year-old homeowner says he was under the impression that they were police officers, too.  I thought they were SFPD,  says Sergio Calderon.  That's why I let them in.  The search turned up nothing, but Calderon says the visitors made veiled threats.  One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble.  The saga began when an Apple employee reportedly left the prototype at a local tequila bar, as CNET first reported. Apple techs traced the device to Calderon's home and requested police help in getting it back.

"(Mar 30, 2011  7:49 AM CDT) Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy is taking some heat from liberal blogs like Think Progress over an exchange at a town hall meeting last week, in which he assured constituents that his $174,000 salary wasn't all that great. A constituent told Duffy that his wife, a teacher, was being asked to take a pay cut, and asked how much Duffy made, and if he'd take a cut. In reply, Duffy spent several minutes complaining about his federal benefits, which he says  don't even compare  to the  gold plated  ones he earned as a Wisconsin DA. Duffy then revealed his $174,000 salary, adding,  I didn't vote on that.  The constituent sputtered,  that's three times—that's three of my family's—that's three times what I make.  Duffy reiterated that he didn't vote for that salary, but added,  I guarantee that I have more debt than all of you. ... I still pay my mortgage. I drive a used minivan. If you think I'm living high off the hog, I've got one paycheck. So I struggle to pay my bills right now.

They were asked several times to provide documentation showing their eligibility but haven't done so, says a rep for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Advocates for those poised to lose their coverage say that many have tried unsuccessfully to send in relevant documents, either by mail or through the ObamaCare website, the New York Times reports.  It is unduly harsh to terminate coverage while there are still technical problems with the federal system for verifying citizenship and immigration status,  says an analyst. If those affected are able to send in the documents in the future, their coverage could be restored. Meanwhile, another 363,000 people whose incomes the White House couldn't confirm—through tax returns, for instance—may lose financial support for their health coverage. Many would then be unable to pay for coverage, the Times notes. They'll be asked to provide proof of income before Sept. 30 in order to continue receiving financial help.

Prosecutors say Leslie Neuman, 32, had been drinking alcohol before she tucked 6-month-old Connor Kleeman into her bed. He wasn't breathing when Neuman awoke early on Dec. 29, and paramedics were unable to revive him, the Detroit News reports. The Wayne County Medical Examiner ruled the baby had become  wedged  between the bed and the wall, and died of accidental asphyxiation as a result of  bed sharing.  Neuman was arraigned on Monday on charges of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree child abuse. Last year, Neuman had been warned in a class for new mothers about the dangers of  co-sleeping,  People reports. Neuman was enrolled in the class run by Child Protective Services after a tipster told authorities it looked like she was going through drug withdrawal. Neuman's lawyer, Maggie Cotant, acknowledges that her client sought help at a drug and alcohol treatment center while pregnant, but says it played no role in the death. She says Neuman put Connor in her bed because he had a cold and she feared not hearing him if he cried.  This is a person who has been punished enough,  she says. A report found that suffocation was the most common cause of sleep-related deaths in Wayne County in recent years, per Michigan Live. In 2013, prosecutors warned that parents would face criminal charges if they place their children in  unsafe sleeping environments.

"(Nov 19, 2015  1:48 PM) The House overwhelmingly approved legislation Thursday to make it harder for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the United States. The AP calls the 289-137 vote a  stinging rebuke  to President Obama, and the Hill points out that 47 Democrats bucked the White House and supported the measure. It now moves on to the Senate, where its fate is unclear. Senators won't take up the matter until after the Thanksgiving recess, and Obama has promised a veto if it reaches his desk. Politico notes that the 289 votes in favor is enough to override the veto in the House, adding that the vote shows Republicans plan to emphasize foreign policy in the 2016 election. The measure, which in effect would suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, would require the FBI to conduct background checks on people coming to the US from those countries. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee  is not a threat to the security of the United States.  The White House has called that requirement  untenable,  reports the New York Times, which describes the new procedures as  difficult to implement.",47 Democrats Buck Obama on Syrian Refugees,____ Democrats Buck Obama on Syrian Refugees,47,Copy( 47 ),0
"(May 22, 2017  10:53 AM CDT) The Supreme Court struck down two North Carolina congressional districts Monday because race played too large a role in their creation, reports the AP. The justices ruled that Republicans who controlled the state legislature and governor's office in 2011 placed too many African-Americans in the districts, weakening African-American voting strength elsewhere. Both districts have since been redrawn, but even so Republicans maintained a 10-3 edge in congressional seats in 2016. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said the state did not offer compelling justification for its reliance on race in either district. The issue of race and redistricting one is a familiar one at the Supreme Court, and Kagan noted that one of the districts was  making its fifth(!) appearance before this court.  The court unanimously affirmed a lower court ruling on District 1 in northeastern North Carolina. Kagan wrote that the court will not  approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence.  The justices split 5-3 on District 12 in the state's southwest. The state argued that Republicans who controlled redistricting wanted to leave the district in Democratic hands, so surrounding districts would be safer for Republicans.  The evidence offered ... adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration,  Kagan wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the four liberal justices. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy dissented.  Partisan gerrymandering is always unsavory, but that is not the issue here,  Alito wrote, per USA Today.  The issue is whether District 12 was drawn predominantly because of race.

"(Dec 21, 2011  7:01 AM) The predictions are getting worse: Japanese officials today said that it could take as many as 40 years to decommission the Fukushima nuclear plant, upping the previous estimate of 30 years. According to the detailed roadmap, TEPCO intends to spend the next two years clearing the spent fuel rods out of the storage pools situated in the reactor buildings; but the lion's share of the time will go to removing the melted nuclear fuel. That process will take some 25 years, and will necessitate the use of robots—and technologies that haven't even been invented yet, reports the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal zeroes in on one of the toughest steps in the process: Figuring out how to drain thousands of tons of irradiated water from the reactor buildings' basements. The cracks that the earthquake created in these buildings will then be repaired, allowing the reactors to be refilled with water, which must occur before the melted fuel can be removed from them. Once that process is complete, it'll be another five to 10 years until the reactors are completely decommissioned.",Japan: 40 Years to Fully Shut Down Fukushima,Japan: ____ Years to Fully Shut Down Fukushima,40,Copy( 40 ),0

The Des Moines Register reports on the recent passing of 5-year-old Garrett Matthias, who died July 6 after a nearly yearlong battle with a rare, aggressive cancer. Over the past few months, Garrett and his parents had some frank discussions about death, and at one point Garrett noted,  Why are funerals so sad? I'm going to have bouncy houses at mine.

The now-viral obituary details his favorite superheroes—including, of course, Thor—things he loves (playing with his sister, thrash metal) and hates ( dirty stupid cancer ), and what he would have wanted to be as an adult: a pro boxer.

Thunberg, 16, beat out other finalists that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Trump, the Hong Kong protesters, and the whistleblower who triggered the Ukraine scandal that has led to Trump's impeachment. The teen's protests against global warming started out as a solo venture in 2018, when she started skipping school on Fridays to sit outside Sweden's parliament building with a sign that read  School Strike for Climate.  She was soon joined by other students in her hometown, and then across Europe, kicking off what became known as the Fridays for Future movement. She's had quite a journey since.

The  majority of Democratic voters,  on the other hand, have grown more populist and want less Wall Street power. The icon for that latter group: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who continues to make a name for herself battling big banks. And therein lies the rub for Hillary Clinton, who may find it difficult to extricate herself from Wall Street ties, writes Noam Scheiber in the New Republic.

And third, she can  awaken in Democratic voters an almost evangelical passion.  Some criticize her for apparently focusing on her image, but it's not that she wants stardom: She's just  relentlessly, perhaps ruthlessly, maybe even a bit messianically, focused on advancing her policy agenda,  Scheiber notes.

"(Feb 17, 2011  12:50 PM) The House today voted 279-143 to approve a 90-day extension of three controversial Patriot Act provisions, sending the measure to President Obama for a surefire signature. The House had earlier approved a year-long extension, but today opted to instead mirror a shorter timeline passed by the Senate, Wired reports. The brief extension is intended to give lawmakers yet more time to debate changes to the provisions, which have raised privacy concerns. At issue are the FBI’s  roving wiretap  powers, which allow them to obtain wiretapping warrants from a secret court without identifying the target, the  lone wolf  measure, which allows the government to monitor people even if they’re not connected to a terrorist organization, and the  business records  provision that allows the government to seize any type of record.

"(May 14, 2013  9:06 AM CDT) When it comes to the fate of the 350 residents of Newtok, Alaska, the Guardian pulls no punches:  Exile is inevitable,  it writes. That's because their coastal village, located some 480 miles west of Anchorage, is in the process of being washed into the Bering Sea. As the Guardian explains in an in-depth look at the town, the Ninglick River flows past three of Newtok's sides on its path to the sea, and it's been chipping away at the village at a rate that's only grown more aggressive due to climate change (more than 100 feet of shoreline gone some years), which has been linked to melting permafrost and dwindling protective sea ice. The US Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the village, and offered no break to the gloom: It concluded that seawalls or other protective measures wouldn't work, and that Newtok's highest point could be underwater in just four years, by 2017. The villagers must leave (a tribal administrator tells Alaska Public Radio relocation has been a major town talking point for the last three decades), leading the Guardian to dub them  America's first climate change refugees.  The villagers selected a new site nine miles away, but moving the town there could cost $130 million, and relocation efforts have yet to truly get off the ground. And while Newtok may be first to disappear, it likely won't be last: A decade-old GAO report found 184 Native villages in Alaska could be at risk.",Alaska Town to Vanish by 2017,Alaska Town to Vanish by ____,2017,Copy( 2017 ),0

I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue. Because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it,  Obama tells CBS News anchor Scott Pelley. What’s more,  this is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans checks, these are folks on disability and their checks.   There are about 70 million checks that go out,  Obama said in the interview, to air tonight. Obama’s remarks come on the heels of Mitch McConnell’s statement that  as long as this president is in the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattainable.

"(Apr 13, 2014  11:14 AM CDT) Thirty years ago, Officer Joanne Jaffe was one of the first responders at the Palm Sunday Massacre, in which 10 victims were killed in Brooklyn. Someone handed Jaffe the sole survivor—13-month-old Christina Rivera, whose mother and two siblings were among the victims—and pictures of the pair appeared on newsstands the next morning. From that point on, Jaffe remained a fixture in Rivera's life—and last year Jaffe adopted Rivera, now 31, reports the New York Times, which is telling their story for the first time.  I was assigned to her and fell in love with her,  says Jaffe, who initially asked to take Rivera home after watching over her at the hospital and a police station 30 years ago Tuesday. Instead, Rivera was reunited with her father and ended up living with her grandmother, but Jaffe visited frequently, playing with Rivera and often bringing gifts and money. As Rivera got older and learned about her mother and siblings' deaths, Jaffe was there to answer her questions and support her, and Rivera eventually started thinking of Jaffe as her mother. She went on trips with Jaffe and her then-fiance, and when Rivera was 14, she moved in with them for about a year. After moving out to live with her father, she remained close with her surrogate parents, who eventually helped send her to college. Rivera eventually got a job with the state and is also an auxiliary police officer, and last year, after her grandmother died, Jaffe made good on a longstanding promise to adopt her.  I can’t imagine my life without her,  Rivera says of her mom.  She taught me what it was like to hope and to truly trust.

The standoff began when a man in an Inglewood home opened fire on two officers who arrived to investigate reports of a family disturbance. A male officer was hurt when he took a bullet in the chest, but his life was saved by his bulletproof vest, reports the Los Angeles Times. He is in good condition, and a female officer injured in a fall as she went to help her colleague was treated in hospital and released. After opening fire, the gunman held two female hostages, believed to be his girlfriend and her 14-year-old daughter, captive while he talked to negotiators for hours. The 45-year-old, who police say has a criminal history, eventually let his hostages go and walked out of the house with his hands up.

The women, who shared their stories on condition of anonymity, describe varying offenses—including forcible kissing, groping, and being propositioned for sex—while 52-year-old Halperin was political director at ABC News a decade ago. Three of the women also say Halperin pressed up against them with an erection while clothed. Halperin, now an NBC News analyst, denies that claim in a statement, but admits  I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me.  He says,  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.  In its own statement, NBC News calls the allegations  very troubling  and says Halperin will be removed as contributor  until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.  Meanwhile, ABC News notes  no complaints were filed  against Halperin before his departure from ABC in 2007. One of the women who spoke to CNN, however, says she told her mentor at ABC when Halperin forcibly kissed her, grabbed her breasts, and pressed his penis against her in his office. The mentor told her he wanted to notify management, the woman says, though it isn't clear if he ever did.

It’s a four-door sedan—the last such car remaining in the competition—and it runs on good old-fashioned gasoline, NPR reports.

With racing, it’s all about pushing performance to the absolute,  says one of the racing veterans working on the car.  With the other automakers, they've become so stuck because the cars that they're producing next year rely on parts that were used this year.

Add Kidney Disease for 9/11 Rescue Workers!  the signs outside MetLife Stadium and the Holland Tunnel and on NYC buses read, referring to the illness 44-year-old Mike Megna says he came down with due to dust at the decimated World Trade Center, where he toiled for three weeks after the attacks. Megna started seeing smaller symptoms, like a constantly runny nose and digestive issues, early on, but in 2006 blood began showing in his urine, and a diagnosis delivered heart-sinking news: He had a  super-rare  form of kidney disease that only 20 people in the world have. And while Megna, who's been disabled since 2011, has applied for compensation cash from the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act of 2010, there's a complication: Kidney disease isn't one of the recognized illnesses covered by the fund. That means the divorced dad of three isn't eligible for any money—even though Mary Ann McLaughlin, a Mount Sinai Medical Center researcher who petitioned the fund two years ago to add the disease based on initial research, has examined Megna's records and believes the WTC toxins  may more likely than not  be tied to his sickness. However, a rep for the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which runs the program, says a disease can be added to the list—and compensation issued—only after  published, peer-reviewed epidemiologic evidence  shows  substantial support  for a direct link between the WTC fallout and the disease. Megna will have to hold tight, per the rep, who says once McLaughlin publishes her study, kidney disease eligibility will be considered.

"(Feb 11, 2014  5:51 AM) Famed child actress Shirley Temple died yesterday of natural causes at the age of 85, her family says. She passed away at her home in Woodside, Calif.,  surrounded by her family and caregivers.  Born in 1928, Temple soared to fame in the 1930s; she was three when she appeared in her first film, the BBC notes. At six, she won a special kids' Oscar, making her the youngest ever to receive an Academy Award—a distinction she still holds. Temple appeared in 46 films and  one-reelers  before she was 13, the Hollywood Reporter notes, and she was America's biggest box-office draw for four consecutive years, outpacing even Clark Gable. The Reporter explains her star power with these standout figures: An average 16,000 letters were sent to her a month; one birthday, fans sent her 167,000 presents. Temple was spotted at a Los Angeles dance school, and soon appeared in a series of one-reelers called  Baby Burlesks,  which she later called  a cynical exploitation of our childish innocence that occasionally were racist or sexist.  Her first feature film was Stand Up and Cheer in 1934, the BBC reports; at age 6, she was making $1,250 per week—with her mother serving as her hairstylist for each film, forming an exact 56 curls every time. At 21 in 1950, she retired from the silver screen (the AP has a list of her feature films), though she appeared on television in the 1950s and 1960s. She went on to become a US diplomat and foreign ambassador under four different presidents.

"(Jun 25, 2012  3:44 PM CDT) Microsoft is paying $1.2 billion to buy Yammer, an Internet startup that has built a social network similar to Facebook for the business world. The deal announced today comes nearly two weeks after word of Microsoft's negotiations with Yammer first leaked out in published reports. Yammer provides ways for companies to create private social networks for their employees. It has more than 5 million corporate users. The acquisition represents Microsoft's latest attempt to adapt to a major shift in the technology industry, one that is fueling demand for more Internet services and social-networking tools. That shift is threatening to weaken Microsoft's position as the world's largest software maker. Last year, Microsoft Corp. bought Internet video chat service Skype for $8.5 billion in the biggest acquisition in the company's 37-year history.

"(Jul 8, 2014  12:18 PM CDT) The White House had been kicking around the idea of requesting $2 billion to deal with the unprecedented wave of underage immigrants arriving from Central America. Today, in a sign of just how fast the crisis is escalating, it made a formal request to Congress for nearly twice that amount, reports the Washington Post. The $3.7 billion would be divvied up among various agencies with a two-pronged goal: to speed up the deportation process while making sure that the kids get adequate health care in detention centers in the interim. Among other things, the money would be used to send more immigration judges to the border, build more holding centers, and beef up border-security patrols. More than 50,000 unaccompanied minors and about 40,000 women with children have been caught on the border this year, mostly in Texas, far more than any other year. The White House said yesterday that most would not be allowed to stay, reports the Hill. Congress must approve the money, and a spokesperson for John Boehner suggested that it wouldn't be a quick vote.  The speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas, which this proposal does not address,  he said.

A fifth American detained in Iran, a student, was released in a move unrelated to the swap, US officials said. Rezaian; former US Marine Amir Hekmati; pastor Saeed Abedini; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose name had not been previously made public, were to be flown from Iran to Switzerland aboard a Swiss aircraft and then transported to a US military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, for medical treatment. The student, identified as Matthew Trevithick, was released independently of the exchange on Saturday and already was on his way home, said US officials. In return, the US will pardon or drop charges against seven Iranians—six of whom are dual US-Iranian citizens—accused or convicted of violating US sanctions. The deal comes ahead of the expected implementation of the landmark deal on Iran's nuclear weapons. Rezaian was born in California and holds both US and Iranian citizenship. He was convicted in closed proceedings last year after being charged with espionage and related allegations.

"(Jun 25, 2018  8:41 AM CDT) Only 28,000 of the planet's 7 billion people are eligible to take the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi. And yet that tiny population enabled drugmaker Vertex to make roughly $1.3 billion in sales off the product. How does that math work out? The annual price of the drug is $272,000 a year, a figure perhaps even more eye-popping when the drug's effectiveness is factored in. In a piece that focuses on how New York state is using a new law to push back against that sticker price, the New York Times explains the drug's positioning: 2012 saw the approval of the first drug that tries  to counteract the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis.  But Kalydeco can only be used by a small subset of patients with a specific genetic mutation. When Orkambi followed in 2015, it was hailed for its ability to treat nearly 1 of every 2 patients—except it's not as effective. Medicaid must cover almost all FDA-approved drugs; per federal law, state programs get a minimum 23% rebate. The Times explains New York last year passed a law that enables it to ask pharma companies for a price break if the state's drug budget passes a certain threshold. New York in April determined Orkambi was one of 30 drugs whose cost effectiveness was out of whack. It sought price cuts, specifically one of about 70% off the list price for Orkambi. State officials say Vertex was the only drugmaker who didn't play ball. A rep for Vertex backs that up, saying the company plans to stick with the 23% discount it is required to pay.

Priebke was finally extradited to Italy from Argentina in 1995 to face trial for the 1944 massacre, and he was sentenced to life in prison. However he served that sentence under house arrest at the Rome home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini. Priebke was tried and convicted for his role in the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians by Nazi forces at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome. The massacre was carried out in retaliation for an attack by resistance fighters that killed 33 members of a Nazi military police unit a day earlier. Priebke admitted shooting two people and rounding up victims, but insisted he was only following orders. Priebke escaped in 1946 from a British prison camp in Rimini, a resort town on Italy's Adriatic coast, and lived in Argentina for nearly 50 years before a US television program reported that he was living freely in the country. That started a lengthy extradition process that ended with him boarding a plane in Argentina on Nov. 20, 1995, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials, to stand trial in Italy. The country's highest appeals court upheld his conviction and life sentence in 1998. In a final interview from July released by his lawyer, Priebke denied that Nazis gassed Jews during the Holocaust and accused the West of having fabricated the crimes to minimize the Allies' own abuses during the war.",Nazi War Criminal Erich Priebke Dead at 100,Nazi War Criminal Erich Priebke Dead at ____,100,Copy( 100 ),0

The good Lord in heaven has always assured me that I'd reach this point. I never dreamed it was going to take this long.  He added there would be  a lot of healing and lot of tears  during the four-hour drive to his Billings home, and he thanked Gov. Steve Bullock for keeping his word. The governor, who was not present, previously said he'd look favorably on Beach's request. Beach was serving a 100-year sentence with no possibility of parole for the 1979 beating death of Kimberly Nees, 17, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeast Montana. Bullock noted in his order that Beach was only 17 at the time and exhibited good behavior in prison. The murder of Nees, an honor student, gripped the small town of Poplar after her body was found alongside a river at a popular place for teenagers to party. No arrests were made, and small-town gossip built until Beach confessed to out-of-state police who picked him up on an unrelated crime. But Beach said his 1983 confession in Louisiana was coerced.

In a letter on its website, the company says it would never  do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product,  but it decided to slow down the older phones in an update around a year ago to prevent unexpected shutdowns caused by aged lithium-ion batteries being unable to deliver heavy energy loads, TechCrunch reports. Apple says the cost of out-of-warranty batteries for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later will be reduced from $79 to $29 from the end of January until the end of 2018. The slowdown was not discovered until this month, when Geekbench charted the performance of older iPhones running different versions of iOS. Apple, which apologized to customers feeling  let down,  also says that early in 2018, it  will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.  Apple says that a fresh battery will enable the older models to run at normal speed, Business Insider reports.

According to the BBC, half of his fortune—as well as his New York City home—will go to wife Iman. The rest will be split between his two children, with daughter Alexandria also getting a home in upstate New York.

Police haven't offered any clues about a motive. Quick is a student at the Cy-Fair campus of Lone Star College, and not much is known of him.

Initially reluctant to participate, Dylan was homeschooled and very shy,  said the post. A neighbor described him today as  very calm,  adding that  he's always working with his dad outside.

"(Feb 11, 2016  12:08 PM) Euthanasia is itself not without controversy; the euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of the mentally ill even more so. It's an infrequent practice but one on the rise in the Netherlands, which is thought to have seen no more than five such cases in 1997 but 42 in 2013. Still,  little is known  about these cases, write researchers in a report published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. And so they reviewed the particulars of 66 patients who opted for EAS in the country from 2011 to 2014. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder, but there was also psychosis, PTSD, and anxiety and long-term eating disorders (most had more than one condition). About half had attempted suicide; almost all had a comorbidity (ranging from cancer to arthritis), though the study calls out one healthy 70-year-old woman who simply found her life a  living hell  in the year after her husband's death. As for how they came to end their lives,  the reality of implementing such programs is messy,  Reuters notes. In 32% of the cases, the patient had been refused EAS. The physicians for three of those 21 patients ultimately reversed their decisions; the other 18 got approval from a new physician. In 24% of the cases, there was physician disagreement, per a press release, and the New York Times points out that while most patients had long treatment histories, 56% had turned down at least some treatment. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Paul S. Applebaum sees further  red flags,  among them the 20% who had never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, the  ratio of women to men (2.3 to 1), and the 56% of cases in which social isolation or loneliness was important enough to be mentioned,  raising  the concern that physician-assisted death served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention.

Per MarketWatch, a pair of seats behind the Cubs dugout at Cleveland's Progressive Field for Wednesday night's game sold on StubHub for a record-breaking $19,500 each. Other tickets (including standing-room-only tix, with prices there hovering around $1,000 on StubHub, per SI.com) are also selling well on the secondary-market broker sites, with seats that usually go for around $300 at face value being scooped up for about $4,500 on StubHub.  Game 7 will be in a league of its own for the MLB prices we've tracked over the last seven years,  says the founder of StubHub rival TicketIQ, which notes its own average asking price of $4,700 per ticket—which would take care of about five months' worth of rent for an average apartment in Cleveland, per an apartment rental tracking site the Wall Street Journal checked out. Perhaps one of the prevailing reasons for the high demand? The fact that the Indians haven't nabbed a World Series win since 1948, and the Cubs haven't since 40 years before that.

The line of severe thunderstorms spawned several possible tornadoes, and the threat continued into early Tuesday for southern Alabama, southwest Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle, the AP reports. Four people were killed Monday evening when a tree fell on their mobile home in Rehobeth, Ala., according to a spokeswoman for the Dothan Houston County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for Houston County in the southern part of the state Monday evening.

Authorities in Waltham, about 20 miles outside of Boston, offered a $5,000 reward Tuesday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible for the recent attacks, NBC News reports. The suspect, described as a Black male between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-10 with a medium build, was  lying in wait  for his victims, said Police Chief Keith MacPherson. Lead detective Sgt.

But that may not be enough to keep them—or possible future executives—to run the two mortgage giants, says Melvin Watt, the FHFA director who's now calling to raise that compensation. In a Freddie Mac filing yesterday, his proposal notes the salary increase wouldn't exceed what's made in the lower 25% of the market and doesn't include bonuses.

"(Jun 1, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) Frank Lucas, the former Harlem drug kingpin whose life and lore inspired the 2007 movie American Gangster, has died, a relative said Friday. Lucas, who was 88, died Thursday in New Jersey, nephew Aldwan Lassiter said. Lucas had been in declining health, according to his former lawyer. Raised in North Carolina, Lucas climbed the ranks of crime in Harlem in the 1960s and '70s, becoming a major drug dealer known for supplying huge amounts of particularly potent heroin, per the AP. He said it netted him millions, and authorities seized over $500,000 in cash when they raided his house in Teaneck, NJ, in 1975. He was convicted and sentenced to decades in prison, but he turned informant and was released after about five years. Lucas was quickly arrested again for drug dealing, on a much smaller scale. He served seven more years, getting out again in 1991. Lucas' story became the basis for the Ridley Scott-directed American Gangster, starring Denzel Washington as Lucas and Russell Crowe as Richard  Richie  Roberts. The film got awards buzz but also brought scrutiny of claims about Lucas' legend, particularly a portrayal of him smuggling drugs in US soldiers' caskets during the Vietnam War; he said in 2008 he transported heroin via coffin just once. There was also pushback on an assertion that Lucas rooted out law enforcement corruption, but a suit on that was thrown out. As for Lucas' unquestioned role in supplying heroin that killed some users, he told the AP in 2007 that he regretted it.  I did some terrible things. I'm awfully sorry that I did them. I really am,  he said. Lucas had another brush with the law in 2012: He pleaded guilty to lying to try cashing in twice on a $17,000 federal disability benefit check.

It had names and addresses for both and was dated July 10, 1959.

He had a brilliant career as a glaciologist and all of a sudden, to be cut short that way.

"(Sep 29, 2012  10:09 AM CDT) Former New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger has died at age 86, and the Times has a lengthy obituary here about the man it says  transformed  the paper his grandfather bought in 1896. Sulzberger took over in 1964 and ran the newspaper for more than three decades, emphasizing both journalism and the need to make money to finance it. The Times says a  defining moment  for him was the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, which led to a landmark Supreme Court case backing up freedom of the press. The AP's obituary says Sulzberger  led the newspaper to new levels of influence and profit amid some of the most significant moments in 20th-century journalism.  It notes that he improved the paper's finances by making it more  reader-friendly  with the introduction of color presses and sections devoted to topics such as science, food, and entertainment.

"(Aug 16, 2013  8:12 AM CDT) It looks like the distant relatives of a reclusive heiress may get a chunk of her estate after all. NBC reports that settlement talks are under way over the more than $300 million left behind by the reclusive Huguette Clark, daughter of a copper magnate. Of course, given that 60 attorneys are involved, it's also possible the talks will fall through and the case will go to trial as scheduled next month. Clark specifically stated in her will that she didn't want any money to go to far-flung relatives she barely knew, but 19 have challenged the will in court. Most never met her in person—in fact, the Daily Mail notes that only funeral home employees were present at her burial. As it stands, Clark left her fortune mostly to charity, though her longtime nurse and other employees were included.

Yesterday's winning bid on the Dell Poweredge R410,  complete with hard drives, motherboard and everything,  came from a 17-year-old, but the cash—$33,000—was to come from his unknowing dad's account, Wired reports. It was no mistaken clicking either; the boy initially bid $10,200, then bid seven more times before he finally won the server, described on eBay as the  notorious physical server that changed the world.  The server's actual worth is probably closer to $4,000, but it's  a relic of our time,  Bahnhof's CEO tells Reuters.  I believe this box has a very high symbolical value. In a way, it is a kind of artifact, an object that has made a mark on world history.  But WikiLeaks, not too thrilled with the auction, claimed it wasn't as important as Bahnhof made it out to be. And the boy's dad seems to agree it's not worth $33,000.  My son is 17 years old and is crazy about conspiracy theory,  he wrote in an eBay message to explain his now called-off bid.

"(Oct 10, 2014  8:50 AM CDT) A new  end-of-flight scenario  paints a picture of how Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went down. Relying on satellite communications and an unanswered ground-to-air phone call placed 17 minutes after the last recorded radar data, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau arrived at the following scenario: The Boeing 777 ran out of fuel after leaving its flight course, the right engine quit before the left, and the plane spiraled into the Indian Ocean west of Australia, USA Today reports.  This scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiraling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flameout,  the report states. Flight 370's final resting place based on that scenario may not be too far from where investigators are searching for the plane, which vanished March 8. Per the report, it  may be located within relatively close proximity  to the current search area in the  7th arc.  NBC News notes the report's assertion that  the next, underwater phase of the search should be prioritized further south within the wide search area.

That's because he makes much of the 23-mile journey on foot, resulting in a 21-mile round-trip walk every day, the Detroit Free Press reports. His car broke down about a decade ago and he's been walking ever since, combining the slog with bus rides in the few areas where buses are available. Once he's worked from 2pm to 10pm, he heads home again in the dark, normally arriving around 4am. With some buses shut down for the day by that point, he walks a total of 13 miles, the Free Press notes. Faith and determination keep him going, he says. He was mugged once, his boss says, though Robertson himself only mentions that he walks through some dangerous areas. But the many miles have their benefits: He loves his co-workers, and his boss's wife cooks him dinner every night.  She takes care of James.

Investigators—who initially believed 33-year-old Anthony Sanders suffocated his daughter, possibly when she interrupted him playing computer games on Dec. 12, 2015—say Sanders' son admitted to causing his sister's death while their father cared for them at a home in the Fort Worth suburb of Watauga, per Fox News. Sanders' son, who at the time reportedly told his father the toddler was asleep and wouldn't wake up, was then just 5 years old, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Sanders, who had maintained his innocence, had been in jail since April 2016 but was released days after his Sept. 11 trial was to have commenced following a phone call between prosecutors and the mother of Sanders' kids, Cassie Wright.

While recreational marijuana use is now legal in Washington and Colorado, a majority of survey participants don't seem that interested in toking up: The study finds that not only are 92% of workers not planning on smoking before work in the future, but an even higher number—94.4%—say they wouldn't consider getting high while on the clock.

Gaby Scanlon, now 20, was with friends at Oscar's Wine Bar and Bistro in Lancaster in October 2012 to celebrate her 18th birthday when one of the staff handed her a free  Nitro-Jagermeister  shot.  I turned to the man and asked if it was OK to drink,  Scanlon told a Preston Crown Court yesterday.  He said 'yes.' Smoke was coming from my nose and mouth. Straight away I knew something was not right.  It wasn't: Internal tissue was destroyed and her stomach lining perforated, and she had to undergo emergency surgery to remove her stomach and have her small bowel attached to her esophagus. The bar's director was said to have been  intrigued by the dramatic effect  of a similar drink at a London hotel, so he decided to bring it to Oscar's. But a local health inspector had been concerned about the offering when he checked out the bar in May 2012 and had sent the bar a letter with notes on the safe way for liquid nitrogen drinks—which the BBC says aren't illegal—to be consumed; he says he never heard back from the bar. Scientists say the drink has to completely settle down and the liquid must evaporate before it's consumed, the broadcaster notes.

If the proposal from the US Preventive Services Task Force is finalized, which is expected to happen around a month from now, insurers will be required to cover the earlier screenings under the Affordable Care Act, the Wall Street Journal reports. The American Cancer Society made the same recommendation in 2018. The National Cancer Institute says that while overall colorectal cancer deaths are decreasing, cases rose by 51% between 1994 and 2014 in people under 55. Deaths in that age group rose 11% from 2005 to 2015.  The risk of getting colon cancer for a 45-year-old today is the same as for a 50-year-old in the past,  says panel chairman Dr. Alex Krist, per the New York Times. The panel said that Black people in particular should be encouraged to undergo screening early because they are among the groups most at risk. Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer this year at age 43, four years after he was diagnosed. While the recommendation for screening to start at age 45 would not have affected his case, doctors say they hope the change will raise awareness of the disease among younger people and encourage them and their doctors to take warning signs like rectal bleeding seriously.

Publisher Harper announced today that Go Set a Watchman, a novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author completed in the 1950s and put aside, will be released July 14. Rediscovered last fall, Go Set a Watchman is essentially a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although it was finished earlier. The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years. The publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies.  In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman,  the 88-year-old Lee said in a statement issued by Harper.  It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became To Kill a Mockingbird) from the point of view of the young Scout.   I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.  Carter came upon the manuscript at a  secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird,  the publisher says. The new book is set in Lee's famed Maycomb, Ala., during the mid-1950s, 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird and roughly contemporaneous with the time that Lee was writing the story. Lee's publisher said the author is unlikely to do any publicity for the book. And despite Lee's stated preference for paper, Watchman will also be released in electronic form.",Harper Lee Is Publishing Her 2nd Novel,Harper Lee Is Publishing Her ____nd Novel,2,Copy( 2 ),0

Foray died Wednesday of cardiac arrest, but she had been in fragile health since a car accident two years ago, her niece said. Foray was the best-known woman among the voice performers who contributed so much to the classic cartoons of Warner Bros., Disney, Hanna-Barbera, and other studios. She had a galaxy of ways to create funny but believable characters, but could also be warm and wise in Disney's Mulan or, in a memorable Twilight Zone episode, chilling.

People don't think of him as a squirrel. They think of him as a person. And he's a good little person.  The original Rocky and Bullwinkle aired in 326 short installments. The Cold War conflict pitted the moose and squirrel against the bumbling spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, to whom Foray also gave a voice.

Coconuts Bangkok reports Thai resident Attaporn Boonmakchuay was five minutes into his  usual bowel movement  Wednesday morning when a huge python bit him on the penis. The 10-foot snake had, well, snaked its way through his home's plumbing, according to the AP. Sky News reports Attaporn's wife and neighbor entered the blood-soaked bathroom to help, but their efforts with a knife and rope were fruitless. It seems getting a snake off one's penis is just something a man has to do himself.  All of a sudden … it began to lose some strength, so I used my hand to prise open its mouth,  Sky News quotes Attaporn as saying.  Then the snake released its grip.  In all, it took the 38-year-old Attaporn—who understandably passed out immediately afterward—more than half an hour to free his penis from the python's jaws. Emergency workers arrived to find the snake still partially inside the toilet. They freed it with hammers and planned to release it back into the wild. Attaporn was rushed to the hospital with a 3-inch wound on his penis. Doctors say he was lucky the python's bite didn't puncture his urinary tract, and he is expected to recover.

"(Nov 12, 2014  9:02 AM) When you've had the bestselling vehicle in the US for 32 years, why change the formula? To make it even better, Ford argues. That's why the company's 2015 F-150, which will appear at dealerships next month, will have a body made almost entirely out of aluminum rather than steel. Customers' biggest concern about pickup trucks is their gas mileage, executive chairman Bill Ford tells the New York Times. With the aluminum version some 700 pounds lighter than previous models, the F-150 will see its mileage improve by 5% to 15%, Ford says. Aluminum is as strong as steel, the AP reports, though it's a little pricier. The base model will now cost an additional $395, making it $26,615. And right now, gas prices are around their lowest in four years. But  even with gas at $3 a gallon, fuel economy is still very important to people,  says Bill Ford. The 2014 F-150 gets about 19 miles per gallon, the Times notes; the official figures for the 2015 model haven't yet been revealed. In other improvements, the new model can tow 1,100 pounds more than its predecessors, while it hauls up to 530 pounds more, the Detroit News reports.

The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, a group of 15 trusts holding 800,000 student loans worth around $12 billion, has been pursuing borrowers in court, but case after case is being tossed out because the trusts have been unable to produce paperwork proving they actually own the loans, the New York Times reports. Lawyers say that since the loans generally passed through many hands before reaching National Collegiate, the paperwork involved is so shoddy that it could affect most of the $5 billion of its debt that is in default. Some borrowers say the company has sued them trying to collect on high-interest loans that they never even took out. National Collegiate has been going after old debts so aggressively that Bloomberg dubs it a  lawsuit machine,  though lawyers say that since most debtors who are sued either pay up or ignore the summons, resulting in a default judgment, the company tends to back off in the relatively rare cases when debtors go to court. But such cases may become more common:  As news of the servicing issues and the trusts’ inability to produce the documents needed to foreclose on loans spreads, the likelihood of more defaults rises,  the company's lawyers warned in a recent filing.",Paperwork Errors Could Wipe Out $5B in Student Loans,Paperwork Errors Could Wipe Out $____B in Student Loans,5,Copy( 5 ),0

"(Feb 9, 2017  9:00 AM) A colossal panoramic painting depicting the Battle of Atlanta from the US Civil War will be lifted by cranes from the building where it's been housed for nearly a century and then trucked to its new location. Moving the 6-ton Cyclorama, one of the nation's largest paintings, from Grant Park to the Atlanta History Center across town marks a major milestone in its restoration, historians say. The move—which architects and engineers have coordinated with German, Swiss, and US conservators—is expected to begin Thursday and take two days, the AP reports. The painting's vivid scenes of charging soldiers, rearing horses, and broken bodies stretches the length of a football field when it's fully unfurled. But to prep for its big move, it's been cut at a seam into two pieces. Both pieces are already rolled onto gigantic, custom-built steel spools, each of them taller than a four-story building. Holes have been cut in the concrete roof of the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum in Grant Park. Cranes will be used to lift the spools through the roof and onto waiting trucks for the trip to a building under construction at the history center, says Howard Pousner, a center spokesman. Those in charge say they're using extreme caution to ensure the 15,000-square-foot painting isn't damaged.  If there's anything that endangers the painting, we will slow down to a crawl,  Pousner notes. The artwork, created by the American Panorama Co. in the 1880s, is one of only two such panoramas on display in the US. The other one is at Pennsylvania's Gettysburg National Military Park.

"(Sep 6, 2018  4:21 PM CDT) Jocelyn Bell Burnell was a PhD student at Cambridge University some five decades ago when she made an astronomical discovery while reviewing data from a radio telescope: faint, repeating pulses of radio waves. These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as  a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves.  The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prize—but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy. But, since then, Bell Burnell has won plenty of other accolades.  I feel I've done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize,  she tells the Guardian.  If you get the Nobel Prize you have this fantastic week and nobody gives you anything else. If you don't get the Nobel Prize, you get everything that moves. That's much more fun.  And in November, Bell Burnell will receive another honor: the Breakthrough Prize, a $3 million award funded by Silicon Valley types, such as Mark Zuckerberg. She  thoroughly deserves this recognition,  says Yuri Milner, who founded the Breakthrough Prize, per SA, adding that she  revealed one of the most interesting objects in the universe.  Bell Burnell says she'll give the prize money to the Institute of Physics to fund graduate scholarships for groups that are underrepresented in physics, per the AP.","Scientist Passed Over for Nobel Wins $3M, Donates It","Scientist Passed Over for Nobel Wins $____M, Donates It",3,Copy( 3 ),0

I got pepper-sprayed with no warning,  said one student, 21, who had been standing in a hallway outside the meeting. A college spokesman, who noted pepper spray has never been used before on campus, said it was the  judgment of campus police that the crowd was getting out of hand,  reports the AP. At least two people were taken to a nearby hospital. Others standing in the hallway were overcome by the spray that filled the enclosed space, reports the Los Angeles Times.  I saw all these students rushing and they were crying,  said a 19-year-old student.  I couldn't stop coughing.  The students had planned to enter the meeting during the public comment portion.

"(Sep 20, 2017  10:05 AM CDT) Feathers, wishbones, colored eggs. If they're things you associate as only found in birds, you're wrong, says paleontologist Mark Norell. It turns out dinosaurs evolved all three, though we've only just recently learned about that last item. The discovery of fossil egg-shells in China has upended the conventional wisdom that all dino eggs were white, a belief born out of the fact that, as National Geographic reports, lizard, turtle, and crocodile eggs are white. But as a study newly published in Peer J explains, researchers now believe that a species of oviraptor named Heyuannia huangi laid blue-green eggs. While fossil eggs often end up looking brown or black, the 67 million-year-old ones found in China seemed blueish, which led scientists to try—and, as it turns out, succeed—to identify bits of colored pigments. The two, biliverdin (blue) and protoporphyrin (red), are typically found in today's bird eggs, and the researchers speculate that the coloring may have worked as a protective camouflage.  It was a huge surprise. I couldn't believe it,  says co-author Jasmina Wiemann. The findings suggest the dinosaurs were at least partially open nesting, as  colored eggs are present in most modern birds which build open nests, as the eggs are vulnerable due to periods without parental guarding.  A 2015 report from CBS News on the initial findings shares another hypothesis: that male oviraptors may have provided care for the eggs, as is the case among their colored-egg modern bird counterparts.

Nine federal search warrants were executed in Bardstown, south of Louisville, including at the homes of Brooks Houck, his brother, and their mother. Houck is the father of one of Crystal Rogers' children and was living with her when she vanished over Fourth of July weekend. Her mother reported Rogers missing on July 5 after not hearing from her for two days, per USA Today. Rogers' car was then found with a flat tire along the Bluegrass Parkway with her keys, phone, and purse inside. The FBI says she would not have traveled without her kids. Houck's brother, Nick, was a Bardstown police officer at the time but was fired in October 2015 for interfering in the investigation.

In a trial involving more than 11,000 at-risk people in Guinea, nobody given the vaccine developed the virus after a 10-day incubation period, researchers wrote in a study published in the Lancet medical journal Thursday.  While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,  says the study's lead author, World Health Organization Assistant Director-General Marie-Paule Kieny. Only two patients suffered serious reactions to the vaccine, and no long-term problems were reported. Researchers are still trying to determine how long the vaccine is effective for.

The USS Gabrielle Giffords, constructed by Austal USA in Mobile, Ala., has completed testing in the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to be commissioned in mid-2017, the AP reports. The company handed over the $475 million ship to the Navy on Friday. Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot during a 2011 assassination attempt, helped christen the ship in 2015. The 421-foot-long Giffords will be the ninth in a series of high-speed vessels designed to navigate in shallow coastal regions known as littoral waters. It's part of a hotly debated program that congressional critics slam as flawed and too expensive but that Navy leaders defend as a critical new step in naval warfighting. Arizona Sen. John McCain has cited the $12.4 billion spent for 26 littoral combat ships as the worst example of wasteful Pentagon spending. The ship's name also has become a target for conservatives who see it as promoting stricter gun laws, a cause Giffords has promoted.

The problem: a crying  Caucasian woman  who said her backpack had been stolen at a train station at 2:30am.  The woman's description of the culprit was limited at best—i.e., a young African American male with a dark hoodie,  the lawsuit states. Owens had no backpack, offered up his punched timecard, and gave cops contact info for his supervisor, but police took the word of the witness—described in the police affidavit as  erratic, possibly intoxicated, and definitely hysterical,  per the Daily News—and carted Owens off.

After the Nazis took over his homeland in 1939, Tadeusz Sawicz made his way to France, where he fought until Paris fell; he then took up the fight in Britain in July 1940, just as the Luftwaffe began its three-month-long failed assault on England. Some 17,000 Polish pilots, mechanics, and ground staff fought for Britain, leading Winston Churchill to say of the decisive victory,  Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.  Sawicz earned Distinguished Flying Crosses from Poland four times, as well as the American, British, and Dutch equivalent for his service during the war. After Poland was taken over by Soviet-backed communists at World War II's close, Sawicz moved to Britain and later emigrated to Canada in 1957.

A Jackson police officer looked up in the sky and saw the Piper PA-32  spitting and sputtering  like it was out of fuel, he would later tell the plane's owner, a budding pilot whose own life was spared when he decided to go deer hunting instead of flying yesterday afternoon. One of the aviators asked for permission to return to the airport, but just minutes later the plane went down. It crashed through trees before slamming into a house that quickly caught fire, sending long flames and black smoke through the neighborhood of modest single-family homes. A deputy fire chief said that one person escaped the burning home with minor injuries, but it was not immediately clear if anyone else was inside.

CNN reports that Reynolds was in tears when the bidding ended after 20 minutes, with the buyer paying $4.6 million for the dress and another $1 million to the auction house. The dress was only expected to fetch $2 million; the previous record for a Marilyn dress was $1.26 million, for the gown she wore while singing  Happy Birthday  to JFK. Three more Monroe dresses, worn in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, There's No Business Like Show Business, and River of No Return brought in another $2.7 million.

A campaign aide confirmed that Romney will be keeping his private insurance plan. The candidate's Medicare policy statement says he believes wealthier seniors should receive less support, although Democrats are likely to use his decision to portray him as out of touch with the average American senior, Politico notes. Romney's campaign marked his birthday by issuing a memo accusing President Obama of trying to  end Medicare as we know it  through spending cuts and other means.

"(May 19, 2016  1:05 PM CDT) Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll released Thursday. These financial difficulties span all income levels, according to the poll conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In households making less than $50,000 a year, 75% of people would have difficulty coming up with $1,000 to cover an unexpected bill. But when income rose to between $50,000 and $100,000, the difficulty decreased only modestly to 67%. Even for the country's wealthiest 20%—households making more than $100,000 a year—38% say they would have at least some difficulty coming up with $1,000. As to how they'd pay it, among those who wouldn't use cash they had on hand, a third said they would have to borrow from a bank or from friends and family, or put the bill on a credit card; 13% would skip paying other bills, and 11% said they would likely not pay the bill at all. Those numbers suggest that most American families do not have at least $1,000 stashed away in an accessible savings account, much less under their mattresses, to cover an emergency. Still, two-thirds of Americans said they feel positive about their finances, according to the survey data, which the AP sees as a sign that they're managing day-to-day expenses fine.

But the Brooklyn girl remains on life support as her parents fight over her organs: Mom Teoka Spruill wants them donated, while dad Terrell Smith doesn't want his daughter's body cut up and  desecrated,  the New York Times reports.  She was born with that, she’s going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes—it’s what makes her her,  Smith, 26, tells the paper.  My daughter was born with that, and she’s going to lie down with the same thing.  But Spruill paints him as an absent father who didn't care much about his daughter until Spruill, 25, married David Adams, also 25, last spring. Adams has been charged with assault, and could see those charges upgraded to murder. But all of that is on hold as Thaiya's parents fight over how to proceed. At a family court hearing today, Spruill was expected to argue that she has proof she had sole custody and can thus decide what happens to Thaiya's organs. But Smith insists he fought for custody, and says he told officials this summer that he worried she was being abused. They investigated in September, during which time Thaiya stayed with her maternal great-grandmother, but she was ultimately returned home. The following month, Smith kept Thaiya at his own mother's house for two weeks—she cried because she didn't want to return home, he says—and ended up arrested over it; Spruill got an order of protection against him after claiming he threatened to kill her.",2-Year-Old Girl Kept Alive as Parents Fight Over Organs,____-Year-Old Girl Kept Alive as Parents Fight Over Organs,2,Copy( 2 ),0

In July, he was arrested and accused of abusing 24 boys. The State's Attorney for Charles County says Bell is accused of abusing boys between the ages of 11 and 17 at Benjamin Stoddert Middle School, his home, and other locations. Bell is HIV-positive, and five counts in the new indictment accuse him of trying to transmit the virus to his victims, People reports. None of them have tested positive, authorities say, though 14 of the 42 have yet to be identified. Bell, who allegedly forced the boys to perform sex acts on him and recorded the abuse on video, was investigated and removed from his job late last year after a parent found inappropriate messages from him on her son's phone. The indictment includes 22 counts of sexual abuse of a minor, 19 counts of second-degree sex offenses, seven counts of third-degree sex offenses, 97 counts of child pornography, and other offenses.

"(Dec 16, 2019  10:35 AM) Anyone expecting February's Iowa caucuses to add a little clarity to the Democratic race might want to adjust those expectations. As the Des Moines Register reports, new rules this year make it possible that three different candidates could emerge from the Feb. 3 caucuses claiming to be the winner. The short version of the explanation: The state Democratic Party will for the first time be disclosing raw vote totals from the caucuses. The longer explanation involves an understanding of the arcane way the state caucuses work. As reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel writes, the traditional  winner  in Iowa has long been decided  by a complicated system of state delegate equivalents, which operates kind of like the Electoral College.  That won't change—one candidate will still be the winner in terms of delegates. But the state party will for the first time disclose raw totals from the first count of votes at gatherings (the  first alignment ), as well as from the second and final one. Of course, one candidate could sweep them all,  but it's also fully possible that a different candidate could 'win' each of the three metrics,  writes Pfannenstiel. Each would come with its own bragging points. Meanwhile, an analysis at Fortune makes the case that while Iowa typically doesn't decide who will be president, it plays a strong role in deciding who won't be president.

It seems the tent was shut down while Obama was inside, and visitors were allowed in only after being screened by the Secret Service.

The Wall Street Journal reports it now has the story behind that second figure. Per its reporting, Trump's former lawyer engaged the tech firm RedFinch Solutions LLC to do two things, the details of which were apparently never conveyed to the Trump Organization: try to sway two online polls in Donald Trump's favor (the effort was unsuccessful) and start and run a praise-filled Twitter account called @WomenForCohen that described him as a  pit bull  and  sex symbol.  He was to pay RedFinch owner John Gauger $50,000 for the work. Gauger, who also serves as CIO at Virginia's Liberty University, claims Cohen didn't fork over that amount.

But Sanders writes for NPR that while the past 12 months may indeed deserve a spot in the midst of a white-hot dumpster fire, 2016 may not have actually been as bad as all that—and  it surely can't be the worst year of all time,  he notes. He runs through things that many Americans can be thankful for, including a recovering economy, our relatively safe existence, and, yes, for Trump supporters, a satisfying conclusion to Election 2016. Plus, much of the  '2016 is awful' rhetoric  was helped along by what Nikki Usher, a George Washington University media professor, calls  ambient journalism,  a nonstop engagement with online news and headlines via social media that basically,  over time … becomes an assault.   Every five minutes, another sad headline, another Twitter mention or fight, another shared link on Facebook, another push notification. Another hit,  Sanders writes. Combine that with this year's seemingly prevailing narrative—that of  a nation, and even a world, completely and disastrously divided, perhaps beyond repair —and it's easy to see why 2016 has earned its black-sheep status on the calendar.  Lots of crappy, bad things happen every year, but you aren't told over and over again that this just shows us how bad everything is,  Usher notes.

He took the oath today before the Supreme Constitutional Court in its Nile-side courthouse built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple. Morsi has vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over after Mubarak's overthrow.

"(May 18, 2012  8:07 AM CDT) Families of 9/11 victims are dismayed that a financial dispute has indefinitely delayed completion of the museum at Ground Zero. The museum, a companion to the 9/11 memorial, was supposed to be finished by this year's 11th anniversary, but officials now say that's not possible. The holdup stems from a financial battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation that controls the memorial and museum, reports the AP. The Port Authority says the foundation owes it $300 million for infrastructure and updated project costs; the foundation counters that the port owes it money because of project delays. Personal items that families have donated to the museum are stuck in storage while the dispute, which has slowed down work since late last year, drags on.  We were supposed to get a contemplative area nearby where we could sit and pray, visit,  says one woman whose sister worked on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's south tower. No trace of her sister was ever identified, and she wants the museum to open so she can visit the thousands of fragments of human remains that could not be identified.

"(Jan 9, 2014  6:20 AM) Werner C. is 88 years old, but his fate now rests with the young offenders chamber of the Cologne court. That's because the man was just 19 during the 1944 massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane in France, in which 642 people were killed, Reuters reports. Men were herded into barns and shot, while the women and children were burned alive in the town church, all in retaliation for the kidnapping of a single German soldier by the French resistance. Prosecutors say Werner, a member of the elite Waffen SS, shot 25 people with his machine gun, and helped burn the church. The pensioner doesn't deny being there, but says he never fired.  I had the great luck of being deployed for something else,  his lawyer quotes him as saying.  He said, 'I heard shots, I saw people shouting, I saw the village burning. It was terrible.'  Oradour-sur-Glane is a touchy subject not just because of the scale of the atrocity, but because no one was ever punished—the unit's commander was captured by Allied forces, but never extradited to France. Prosecutors found Werner thanks to a poster campaign from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, urging Germans to report elderly neighbors they suspected of Nazi war crimes, the New York Times reports.  It's important that we find someone, even if it's 70 years afterward,  said one of the six people who survived the massacre.","Ex-Nazi, 88, in Young Offender Court Over WWII Massacre","Ex-Nazi, ____, in Young Offender Court Over WWII Massacre",88,Copy( 88 ),0

But video has now emerged of that demo in Fort Pierce at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, with the so-called target used to draw the K9 attackers attracting both controversy and an investigation by the Naval Special Warfare Command, the Washington Post reports. As seen in the first clip now circulating on social media, four dogs leap one by one onto a man called  Josh  by the announcer, clamping down on his padded arms and doing their job at subduing him. What's spurring the backlash, however, is what else Josh is wearing: a red Colin Kaepernick jersey. In a second video, Josh is seen taken down by a dog and mock-moaning,  Oh man, I will stand,  which brings laughter from the crowd, per Yahoo Sports. It's not yet clear who recorded the video of the demo, which was originally posted on Instagram in January 2019 in now-deleted posts, with one caption noting the Kaepernick stand-in was set upon by the dogs for  not standing during the national anthem.  BuzzFeed News notes the videos went viral after filmmaker Billy Corben shared them.  The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the US Navy,  the Navy said in a statement, noting it so far doesn't appear any active Navy personnel were involved in the event, or that any Navy equipment was used during the demo.

"(Mar 8, 2013  2:22 PM) The top 83 US-based companies now hold a massive $1.45 trillion offshore, parked in low-tax countries, after increasing those holdings by 14.4%—or $183 billion—just in the last year, reports Bloomberg. The leader in offshore profit parking is GE, with $108 billion, up $6 billion from last year, followed by Pfizer with $73 billion. Tech giants Google, Apple, and Microsoft increased their non-US holdings by 34% last year and $75.2 billion over the past two years. Experts say the rise is due to US tax laws, which incentivize booking profits offshore, and estimate the total amount all US companies (not just the top 83) are keeping offshore could be $1.9 trillion.  The corporate system is broken and it’s broken primarily because of international,  says one professor of tax law. The United States is one of the few countries that applies its full 35% corporate tax rate to profits made by US-based companies' overseas offices, but companies can defer paying taxes until they return those profits home.

"(Jun 16, 2015  9:48 AM CDT) The Obama administration is cracking down on artificial trans fats, calling them a threat to public health. The FDA said today it will require food companies to phase out the use of artificial trans fats almost entirely. Consumers aren't likely to notice much of a difference, but the administration says the move will reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year. The FDA made a preliminary determination in 2013 that trans fats no longer fall in the agency's  generally recognized as safe  category, and made that decision final today, giving food companies three years to phase them out. With trans fats off the list, any company that wants to use them will have to petition the FDA, which is unlikely to allow many uses. Once a staple of the American diet—think shortening and microwave popcorn—most trans fats are already gone. The FDA says between 2003 and 2012, consumer trans-fat consumption decreased about 78% as food companies used other kinds of oils. Still, the FDA says those trans fats still in the food supply are a public health concern. Scientists say there are no health benefits to trans fats, created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid (they're often called partially hydrogenated oils). Trans fats are used in processing food and in restaurants, usually to improve texture, shelf life, or flavor, but they can raise levels of  bad  cholesterol and lower  good  cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. The FDA hasn't targeted small amounts of trans fats that occur naturally in some meat and dairy products because they'd be too difficult to remove.

The tennis star found three of her sponsors—Nike, Tag Heuer, and Porsche—swiftly backing away from her. A  saddened and surprised  Nike announced it would suspend their relationship during the course of the investigation. The BBC reports on just how big a deal this is: The 28-year-old's relationship with the company began when she was just 11; the two signed a $70 million, 8-year contract in 2010, and she has her own clothing line with the company. As for the others: Swiss watch brand Tag Heuer had been in talks with Sharapova to renew a sponsorship that ended in 2015, but  in view of the current situation,  no renewal will take place. Porsche, whose contract with Sharapova runs through 2016, has  chosen to postpone planned activities  with her  until further details are released and we can analyze the situation.  The drug in question is described by the AP as the  little-known  meldonium. Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, has been taking it for a decade; it only this year became a banned substance as per World Anti-Doping Agency code, due to its potential to bolster oxygen uptake and endurance. The drug promotes blood flow, and the New York Times quotes Sharapova's description of why she started taking it:  I was getting sick very often. I had a deficiency in magnesium.

After losing a five-year battle to keep her rent from spiking from $820 to $3,500 per month, Adele Sarno's Little Italy home will likely be taken over by her landlord: the Italian American Museum, which, according to its website, is  dedicated to the struggles of Italian-Americans and their achievements and contributions to American culture and society,  the New York Times reports. The irony isn't lost on Sarno.  I was here all my life,  she tells CBS New York. Of museum founder Joseph Scelsa, she notes,  I'm more the Italian one than he is.  The situation is  absolute hypocrisy,  adds the director of an affordable housing group.

According to the Oregonian, the lawsuit states that a fully-clothed Charles Ziemer was pedaling back to his car after participating in the June 2016 ride when his wheels suddenly struck the islands. The lawsuit faults the city for failing to put reflectors or lights on the islands and situating them in a travel lane.

"(Apr 4, 2018  12:54 PM CDT) Some Google employees have sent CEO Sundar Pichai a letter. Well, more than some: It has at least 3,100 signatures—not quite 5% of the workforce—and implores Pichai to withdraw the company from Project Maven. That's a Pentagon program focused on using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, and the New York Times reports it could increase the precision of drone strikes. The Times sees this fight as a sort of bellwether for what's to come as AI advances developed in Silicon Valley are more frequently put to use by the military.  We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,  states what Fast Company calls a  fiery  letter. The employees write that they want the company to turn that sentiment into policy by pledging to never  build warfare technology.  Though Google says the company's role in Project Maven is limited to  non-offensive purposes,  the letter states that  the technology is being built for the military, and once it’s delivered it could easily be used to assist in  tasks like launching weapons. The Times makes the argument that the publicity around the contract—first revealed in March by Gizmodo—could hamper Google when it comes to the ultra-competitive recruitment of AI researchers, who might find the military connection off-putting. That said, Amazon and Microsoft also have Pentagon contracts, but the letter-signers write that those companies' military work  doesn't make this any less risky for Google. Google's unique history, its motto Don’t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.

"(Jun 10, 2015  6:46 PM CDT) A new batch of cholesterol-lowering drugs could bring new hope to patients who can't take popular statins, or for those who don't feel their effects. Today, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of Amgen's Repatha, reports AP, just one day after it gave the green light to a similar drug called Praluent from Sanofi and Regeneron. Both self-injected drugs are designed to lower LDL cholesterol (the  bad cholesterol ) and belong to a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, HealthDay reports. Early studies suggest they lower LDL more effectively than statins. The FDA will make its decision this summer, but is expected to follow the committee's advice, reports CNN, which calls the drugs  the most important new class of cholesterol-lowering medications since the first statin was approved in 1987.  However,  definitive evidence  on whether they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths won't be out until 2017, after long-term trials, reports the New York Times. While statins are proven to prevent heart attack and stroke, they don't work for everyone, and up to 25% of statin users battle side effects like muscle pain, which hasn't appeared in trials of PCSK9 inhibitors, notes CNN. However, some patients on PCSK9 inhibitors have reported being confused and unable to focus.  For all those patients unable to take statins, finally there might be an option that can change (their) outcomes,  says a cardiologist not involved in the research.  We need to patiently wait for the next phase of trials to see whether the clinical outcomes are as promising as the initial studies suggest.

The Labor Department also had grim news for the previous two months: The economy did not create nearly as many jobs as was originally thought, and those figures have been revised down to show 49,000 fewer jobs created.

But it is also unique, from the moment campers arrive each morning. At check-in each day, campers make a nametag with their pronoun of choice. Some opt for  she  or  he.  Or a combination of  she/he.  Or  they,  or no pronoun at all. Some change their name or pronouns daily, to see what feels right. The camp in the San Francisco Bay Area city of El Cerrito caters to transgender and  gender fluid  children ages 4 to 12, making it one of the only camps of its kind in the world open to preschoolers, experts say. Enrollment has tripled to about 60 young campers since it opened three summers ago, with kids coming from as far as Los Angeles, Washington, DC—even Africa, the AP reports. Plans are underway to open a branch next summer in Colorado, and the camp has been contacted by parents and organizations in Atlanta, Seattle, Louisiana, and elsewhere interested in setting up similar programs. Gender specialists say the camp's growth reflects what they are seeing in gender clinics nationwide: increasing numbers of children coming out as transgender at young ages. They credit the rise to greater openness and awareness of LGBT issues and parents tuning in earlier when a child shows signs of gender dysphoria, or distress about their gender.  A decade ago, this camp wouldn't have existed. Eventually, I do believe, it won't be so innovative,  camp founder Sandra Collins said.  I didn't know you could be transgender at a very young age.

Israel's Antiquities Authority said Wednesday that an excavation exposed two houses with well-preserved remains and floors containing pottery vessels, flint tools, and a basalt bowl. Ronit Lupo, the authority's director of excavations, says the items are representative of the early Chalcolithic period, around 5,000BC.  Apart from the pottery, the fascinating flint finds attest to the livelihood of the local population in prehistoric times: small sickle blades for harvesting cereal crops, chisels and polished axes for building ... even a bead made of carnelian [a gemstone], indicating that jewelry was either made or imported,  Lupo says, per the Times of Israel. Similar developments have been found elsewhere in present-day Israel but not in Jerusalem. The site was discovered while authorities were doing roadwork in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat. The remains reportedly are up to 2,000 years older than other evidence of human settlements previously found in the area, the Times notes.

Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages ($1 for funeral expenses and $1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from $4.

A June 1975 inquest named him as Rivett's murderer, except the man born Richard John Bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned. The sightings and theories kept flowing, though: in Melbourne, Australia, and France within the first year; employed as a waiter in San Francisco; backpacking on Mount Etna; dying in Goa in 1996. Just last Saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger. Lucan was declared dead in 1996, but the rub was that son George Bingham was unable to take on his title, preventing him from assuming his father's seat in the House of Lords. The death certificate now allows for that.",Lord at Heart of 1974 Murder Mystery Is Officially Dead,Lord at Heart of ____ Murder Mystery Is Officially Dead,1974,Copy( 1974 ),0

Some 2,000 have already been evacuated, but the rest are stuck fighting for a coveted ticket on one of the two airlines still operating, or taking their chances with military evacuation operations.

In an early tweet, the president announced he is restoring tariffs on aluminum and steel shipped from Argentina and Brazil, reports the Wall Street Journal.

It appeared the parachute did not deploy until after impact, he said. Authorities were working to identify the bodies, but it appears the victims, both males, were in their 20s. They had jumped from the Parachute Center, a popular skydiving school in the state's Central Valley whose website declares it  one of the largest and oldest drop zones in the United States,  launched in 1964. Parachute Center owner Bill Dause told KCRA-TV the instructor in Saturday's deadly jump was an independent contractor who has made about 700 jumps.  The parachute failed to eject properly.

Those numbers, however, don't even begin to reflect the true damage because the relevant surveys end in the middle of the month, notes the Wall Street Journal. Since then, nearly 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. By May, the US is projected to have lost 28 million jobs and have a jobless rate of 16%, which would wipe out all of the job gains over the last decade, per the Journal.  There's no comparison to this shock,  says Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics.  The sudden drop in economic activity is like what you’d see in an area after a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, but it’s occurring across the entire country.  For the record, Friday's drop in hiring is the first since September 2010, notes CNBC. The figure nearly reached the mark of 800,000 that came at the peak of the 2009 financial crisis, though it will surely exceed that with April's report. Before Friday's report, unemployment had been hovering around a 50-year low.",A 113-Month Streak on Jobs Just Ended,A ____-Month Streak on Jobs Just Ended,113,Copy( 113 ),0
"(Feb 5, 2015  1:50 PM) A tragic story out of Brazil, where a 6-year-old who was in a canoe that capsized was set upon by piranhas and partly  devoured.  It's not clear if the creatures are what killed Adrila Muniz: Local media report she may have drowned. But the BBC cites  graphic  photos taken after death that show her legs essentially void of flesh. Adrila had been in the boat with her grandmother and four other children when it overturned on Jan. 27; the grandmother was able to haul the others back into the canoe. The Daily Mail reports that the child was vacationing with her grandparents. Local media report these wrenching lines from the grandmother:  I tried to hold onto her, but with all the other children around she slipped out of my grasp. I couldn't see her anymore when we got to the bank.  (A piranha-like fish was caught in Michigan over the summer.)",6-Year-Old 'Devoured' by Piranhas,____-Year-Old 'Devoured' by Piranhas,6,Copy( 6 ),0
"(Mar 11, 2019  3:45 AM CDT) USA Cycling says it has suffered a  devastating loss  with the death of Kelly Catlin, a track cyclist who helped the women's pursuit team win silver at the 2016 Rio Games. Relatives say the 23-year-old died by suicide at her Stanford University campus residence Friday night, Reuters reports.  There isn’t a minute that goes by that we don’t think of her and think of the wonderful life she could have lived,  father Mark Catlin tells VeloNews.  There isn’t a second in which we wouldn’t freely give our lives in exchange for hers. The hurt is unbelievable.  Catlin won gold with the US women's team at the world championships in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Catlin, who grew up in Minnesota, was one of a set of triplets. Sister Christine Catlin tells the Washington Post that Kelly was  a really special person—kind, funny, empathetic, and talented at literally everything she did. She just felt like she couldn’t say no to everything that was asked of her and this was her only escape.  She says her sister's mental health suffered after crashes last year in which she broke her arm and suffered a concussion.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Catlin family,  USA Cycling President Rob DeMartini said in a statement.  The entire cycling community is mourning this immense loss.",US Olympic Medalist Kelly Catlin Dead at 23,US Olympic Medalist Kelly Catlin Dead at ____,23,Copy( 23 ),0
