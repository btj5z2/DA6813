The Boston Globe reports that Bernard O'Rourke, police superintendent of the bureau of field services, said officers responded to a report of a fight about 2:15am Sunday in the district, where bars and restaurants cater to nightlife crowds and had just closed. Police say people were stabbed with knives or bottles. Four of the victims were transported to receive medical treatment, while the other three walked into hospitals on their own, a police spokesman tells the Globe. Another police spokesman on Sunday afternoon told the AP the injuries appear to be non-life-threatening; earlier reports had said one person was critically injured. O'Rourke has said a suspect has been IDed—and per RT.com, that suspect was one of the wounded. Police are said to be seeking a second suspect.
